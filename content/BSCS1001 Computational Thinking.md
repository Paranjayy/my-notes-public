# BSCS1001 Computational Thinking

**Course Credits**: 4

**Course Type**: Foundational

**Instructors**: Madhavan Mukund, Dr. G Venkatesh

**Pre-requisites**: None

## Overview
The course introduces fundamental programming concepts through manual problem solving. It focuses on communicating procedural solutions, understanding abstractions and selecting data structures.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply a procedural approach to real-life problems
- Communicate solutions using flowcharts and pseudocode
- Understand variables, iteration, filtering and parameterised procedures
- Choose data structures like lists, trees, matrices and graphs
- Identify algorithmic techniques such as searching, sorting and matching
- Decompose problems using recursion and divide-and-conquer
- Predict and test algorithm behaviour

## Course Structure
12 weeks of coursework with weekly online assignments, two invigilated quizzes and one invigilated end term exam.

## Weekly Topics
1. **Variables & Flowcharts** – declaring variables, tracing simple algorithms by hand, flowchart symbols and sanity checks for input data
2. **Iteration & Selection** – `for` and `while` style loops, filtering items with conditions, basic pseudocode conventions, AND/OR logic
3. **Multiple Iterations** – nested loops for grids, procedures with parameters, side effects of mutation, the OR operator and boolean logic
4. **Nested Iterations** – applying loops inside loops, birthday paradox simulation, binning data into ranges and complexity considerations
5. **Lists** – properties of collections, insertion sort walkthrough and using lists to store dynamic data
6. **Tables & Dictionaries** – mapping keys to values, hashing concepts and dictionary-based counting
7. **Graphs & Matrices** – matrix representations of relationships, adjacency lists vs. matrices and simple graph algorithms
8. **Adjacency Matrices** – storing weighted edges, exploring edge-labelled graphs, memory usage trade‑offs
9. **Backtracking & Trees** – recursion on tree structures, depth-first search exploration, solving puzzles via backtracking
10. **Object-Oriented Concepts** – grouping data and behaviour with classes, objects, constructors and encapsulation
11. **Concurrency** – remote procedure calls, threads, race conditions, locks and deadlocks
12. **Problem Solving Strategies** – breaking problems down, top-down vs. bottom-up approaches, decision trees and basic classification

## Glossary
- **Pseudocode**: a simplified, language-agnostic way to describe algorithms.
- **Recursion**: a technique where a function calls itself to solve subproblems.
- **Encapsulation**: bundling data with methods that operate on that data.
- **Race Condition**: a flaw that occurs when operations depend on timing of events in concurrent systems.


## Additional Topics
- **Heuristics** – strategies for approaching complex problems when an exact solution is impractical
- **Greedy Algorithms** – making the locally optimal choice at each step
- **Complexity Analysis** – big O notation to understand algorithm efficiency
