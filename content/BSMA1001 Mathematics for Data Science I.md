# BSMA1001 Mathematics for Data Science I

**Course Credits**: 4

**Course Type**: Foundational

**Instructors**: Neelesh Upadhye, Madhavan Mukund

**Pre-requisites**: None

## Overview
This course introduces straight lines, polynomials, exponentials, logarithms and the basics of discrete mathematics. Students learn to model real-life problems using abstract mathematical structures.

## Learning Objectives
- Recall the basics of sets and number systems
- Plot and analyse straight lines
- Understand and differentiate between linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions
- Apply algorithmic methods to find roots, maxima and minima of polynomials
- Represent sets and relations as discrete graphs
- Formulate and solve common graph-based problems

## Course Structure
12 weeks of coursework with weekly online assignments, two invigilated quizzes and one invigilated end term exam.

## Weekly Topics
1. **Set Theory** – natural numbers, integers and rationals; set operations; reflexive, symmetric and transitive relations; functions and their types
2. **Coordinate Geometry** – plotting points, slope of a line, parallel and perpendicular lines, line representations and straight-line fitting
3. **Quadratic Functions** – understanding parabolas, vertex form, factorisation, completing the square, maxima and minima
4. **Polynomials** – polynomial arithmetic, long division, synthetic division and graph properties such as multiplicity and turning points
5. **Functions** – inverse functions, one-to-one vs. many-to-one, exponential functions, composition, horizontal and vertical line tests
6. **Logarithmic Functions** – laws of logarithms, log and exponential graphs, solving exponential and logarithmic equations, applications
7. **Sequences and Limits** – arithmetic and geometric sequences, tangent lines, limits of sequences and functions, continuity and discontinuities
8. **Derivatives & Critical Points** – differentiability, product and quotient rules, L'Hôpital's rule, linear approximation and finding extrema
9. **Integrals** – Riemann sums, definite and indefinite integrals, area under curves and the fundamental theorem of calculus
10. **Graph Theory Basics** – representing graphs, BFS and DFS traversals, applications in real life, DAGs and topological sorting
11. **Graph Algorithms** – Dijkstra and Bellman–Ford shortest paths, Floyd–Warshall for all pairs, Prim and Kruskal for minimum spanning trees
12. **Revision** – consolidation of concepts and problem solving

## Glossary
- **Polynomial**: an expression made up of variables and coefficients using only addition, subtraction, multiplication and non-negative integer exponents.
- **Composite Function**: a function created when one function is applied after another.
- **Derivative**: the rate at which a function changes with respect to its input value; geometrically the slope of the tangent.
- **BFS/DFS**: Breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms for exploring graphs.
