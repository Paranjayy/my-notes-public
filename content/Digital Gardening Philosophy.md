# Digital Gardening Philosophy

Digital gardening is a different way of thinking about creating and sharing knowledge online. Unlike traditional blogging, digital gardens are:

## Core Principles

### 🌱 **Growth Over Perfection**
- Content is allowed to be incomplete and evolving
- Ideas can be planted as seeds and grown over time
- No pressure to publish "finished" thoughts

### 🔗 **Connections Over Categories** 
- Knowledge is interconnected, not hierarchical
- Links between ideas are as important as the ideas themselves
- Serendipitous discovery through exploration

### 🚀 **Learning in Public**
- Share your thinking process, not just conclusions
- Document questions and uncertainties
- Build knowledge collaboratively

### 🏡 **Personal Spaces**
- Reflect your unique way of thinking
- Organize content in ways that make sense to you
- Create your own knowledge architecture

## The Garden Metaphor
