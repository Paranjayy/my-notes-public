# Rhizomatic Learning

Rhizomatic Learning is an educational approach inspired by the botanical metaphor of the rhizome. Unlike a single trunk branching outward, a rhizome spreads in many directions with no clear beginning or end. Knowledge grows in a similarly non-linear way when learners explore concepts through connections rather than a strict syllabus.

## Key Ideas
- **Non-linearity**: Learning paths branch and reconnect based on individual curiosity.
- **Community as Curriculum**: What is learned is shaped by the network of participants and their shared interests.
- **Ownership**: Learners direct their own exploration instead of passively following a prescribed course.
- **Adaptability**: Because it is decentralized, a rhizomatic approach embraces change and allows learners to pursue unexpected insights.

Rhizomatic Learning aligns well with digital gardens and personal knowledge management. Notes interlink like rhizome roots, enabling ideas to grow organically across topics.
