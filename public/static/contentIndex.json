It focuses on communicating procedural solutions, understanding abstractions and selecting data structures.\nLearning Objectives\n\nApply a procedural approach to real-life problems\nCommunicate solutions using flowcharts and pseudocode\nUnderstand variables, iteration, filtering and parameterised procedures\nChoose data structures like lists, trees, matrices and graphs\nIdentify algorithmic techniques such as searching, sorting and matching\nDecompose problems using recursion and divide-and-conquer\nPredict and test algorithm behaviour\n\nCourse Structure\n12 weeks of coursework with weekly online assignments, two invigilated quizzes and one invigilated end term exam.\nWeekly Topics\n\nVariables &amp; Flowcharts\n\nWhat is Computational Thinking?:\n\nA problem-solving approach that involves:\n\nDecomposition: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\nPattern Recognition: Identifying similarities or trends within problems or data.\nAbstraction: Focusing on the essential information and ignoring irrelevant details.\nAlgorithms: Developing a step-by-step solution to the problem or parts of it.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms:\n\nDefinition: A sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions or steps designed to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular outcome.\nAnalogy: A recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm – it lists ingredients (inputs) and step-by-step instructions to produce the cake (output).\n\n\nVariables:\n\nConcept: A named placeholder or container used to store a piece of information (a value) that can change or vary during the execution of an algorithm.\nAnalogy: Think of a labeled box (the variable name) where you can store an item (the value). You can change the item in the box.\nDeclaring Variables: Conceptually, this means giving a name to your “box” and perhaps putting an initial item (value) into it. Example: age = 25, userName = &quot;Guest&quot;.\nData Types (Conceptual): Understanding that variables hold different kinds of information:\n\nNumbers: For quantities (e.g., count = 10, price = 19.99).\nText (Strings): For textual information (e.g., message = &quot;Hello&quot;, city = &quot;London&quot;).\nBoolean: For true/false values (e.g., isLoggedIn = true, isValid = false).\n\n\nAssignment: The process of giving a value to a variable. Typically written as variable_name = value or SET variable_name TO value. The value on the right is stored in the variable on the left. Example: score = 100. Later, score = score + 10.\n\n\nTracing Simple Algorithms by Hand (Desk Checking):\n\nImportance: A crucial skill to understand how an algorithm executes, to verify its correctness for given inputs, and to find errors in logic.\nMethod: Create a table where columns represent each variable in the algorithm and one column for the current step or instruction being executed. Sometimes, an additional column for “output” or “conditions” is useful. You manually go through the algorithm step-by-step, updating the variable values in your table as they change.\nExample: Algorithm to Calculate Area of a Rectangle\n\nVariables: length, width, area\nSteps (Pseudocode):\n\nSTART\nGET length\nGET width\narea = length * width\nDISPLAY area\nEND\n\n\nTrace Table Example (Input: length=5, width=3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepInstructionlengthwidthareaOutput1START---2GET length5--3GET width53-4area = length*width53155DISPLAY area5315Display: 156END\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowcharts:\n\nPurpose: A graphical representation of an algorithm, showing the sequence of operations, decisions, and flow of control from start to finish.\nCommon Flowchart Symbols:\n\nOval (Terminator): Represents the Start or End point of the algorithm.\nRectangle (Process): Represents a calculation or an instruction (e.g., area = length * width, increment counter).\nParallelogram (Input/Output): Represents getting input from a user or displaying output (e.g., GET age, DISPLAY result).\nDiamond (Decision): Represents a point where a decision is made, usually a yes/no or true/false question (e.g., Is age &gt; 18?). Has one entry point and two exit points (one for true, one for false).\nCircle (Connector): Used to connect different parts of a flowchart, especially if it spans multiple pages or is complex, to avoid crossing flow lines.\nArrows (Flow Lines): Indicate the direction of flow and the sequence of steps.\n\n\nExample: Flowchart for “Is a number even or odd?”\n\nOval: START\nArrow to Parallelogram: GET number\nArrow to Diamond: Is number % 2 == 0? (where % is modulo/remainder)\nArrow (labeled “Yes”) from Diamond to Parallelogram: DISPLAY “number is Even”\nArrow (labeled “No”) from Diamond to Parallelogram: DISPLAY “number is Odd”\nArrows from both DISPLAY Parallelograms to Oval: END\n\n\n\n\nSanity Checks for Input Data:\n\nConcept: Initial checks performed on input data to ensure it is reasonable, valid, and in the expected format before the main algorithm processes it.\nImportance: Helps prevent program crashes, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities. Embodies the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) principle – if input is bad, output will likely be bad.\nExamples of Manual Sanity Checks:\n\nAge Problem: If an algorithm calculates something based on age, a sanity check would be: “Is the entered age a positive number?” “Is the age less than a reasonable maximum (e.g., 120)?”\nScore Input: If inputting a test score expected to be between 0 and 100: “Is the score ≥ 0 AND score ≤ 100?”\nText Input: If asking for a name: “Is the input text, not a number?” “Is the length of the name reasonable (not empty, not excessively long)?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration &amp; Selection\n\nSelection (Conditional Execution):\n\nConcept: The ability of an algorithm to make decisions and execute different sets of instructions based on whether a certain condition is true or false.\nIF-THEN-ELSE Structure:\n\nPseudocode:\nIF (condition) THEN\n    (steps to perform if condition is true)\nELSE\n    (steps to perform if condition is false)\nENDIF\n\n\nExample: Determine if a number is positive or non-positive.\nGET number\nIF (number &gt; 0) THEN\n    DISPLAY &quot;Number is positive&quot;\nELSE\n    DISPLAY &quot;Number is zero or negative&quot;\nENDIF\n\n\n\n\nIF-THEN Structure: Used when actions are only taken if a condition is true, with no alternative actions if false.\n\nPseudocode:\nIF (condition) THEN\n    (steps to perform if condition is true)\nENDIF\n\n\n\n\nNested IF Statements: An IF statement inside another IF statement, allowing for more complex decision-making.\nExample:\nIF (temperature &gt; 30) THEN\n    DISPLAY &quot;It&#039;s hot.&quot;\n    IF (humidity &gt; 80) THEN\n        DISPLAY &quot;It&#039;s also humid!&quot;\n    ENDIF\nELSE\n    DISPLAY &quot;It&#039;s not hot.&quot;\nENDIF\n\n\n\n\nLogical Conditions and Operators:\n\nBoolean Values: Represent truth values - TRUE or FALSE. Conditions in IF statements evaluate to a Boolean value.\nComparison Operators: Used to compare values.\n\n&gt; (greater than), &lt; (less than)\n&gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than or equal to)\n== (equal to), != (not equal to)\n\n\nLogical Operators: Combine or modify Boolean conditions.\n\nAND: (condition1 AND condition2) is TRUE only if both condition1 and condition2 are TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncond1cond2cond1 AND cond2TRUETRUETRUETRUEFALSEFALSEFALSETRUEFALSEFALSEFALSEFALSE\n\nOR: (condition1 OR condition2) is TRUE if at least one of condition1 or condition2 is TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncond1cond2cond1 OR cond2TRUETRUETRUETRUEFALSETRUEFALSETRUETRUEFALSEFALSEFALSE\n\nNOT: (NOT condition1) reverses the truth value of condition1. If condition1 is TRUE, NOT condition1 is FALSE, and vice-versa.\n\n\n\n\nIteration (Repetition/Looping):\n\nConcept: Repeating a block of instructions multiple times until a certain condition is met or for a predetermined number of repetitions.\nTypes of Loops (Conceptual):\n\nCount-Controlled Loops (FOR style): Used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat the loop.\n\nStructure (Conceptual Pseudocode):\nFOR counter FROM start_value TO end_value [STEP step_increment] DO\n    (steps to perform in each iteration)\nENDFOR\n\n\ncounter is a variable that changes with each iteration.\nstep_increment is often 1 by default.\nExample: Print “Hello” 5 times.\nFOR count FROM 1 TO 5 DO\n    DISPLAY &quot;Hello&quot;\nENDFOR\n\n\n\n\nCondition-Controlled Loops (WHILE style): Used when the repetition continues as long as a specified condition remains true. The number of iterations might not be known beforehand.\n\nStructure (Conceptual Pseudocode):\nWHILE (condition is TRUE) DO\n    (steps to perform in each iteration)\n    (ensure something inside the loop can change the condition to FALSE eventually)\nENDWHILE\n\n\nCaution: If the condition never becomes false, an infinite loop occurs.\nExample: Sum numbers entered by a user until they enter 0.\nSET total_sum TO 0\nGET number\nWHILE (number != 0) DO\n    total_sum = total_sum + number\n    GET number\nENDWHILE\nDISPLAY total_sum\n\n\n\n\nDO-WHILE style (execute once, then check condition):\nDO\n    (steps to perform)\nWHILE (condition is TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Items with Conditions:\n\nCombining iteration and selection to process a collection of items (e.g., a list of numbers, a set of student records) and perform an action only on those items that satisfy a specific condition.\nExample: Given a list of numbers: [10, 7, 4, 15, 3, 8]. Print only numbers greater than 5.\n\nAlgorithm idea:\n\nFor each num in the list:\nIF (num &gt; 5) THEN\n  DISPLAY num\nENDIF\n\n\nThis involves iterating through the list and applying a selection (IF condition) to each item.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Pseudocode Conventions:\n\nPurpose: An intermediate step between an idea/flowchart and actual programming code. It uses plain language mixed with common programming structures to describe an algorithm’s logic clearly and unambiguously, without worrying about the strict syntax of a specific programming language.\nCommon Keywords/Structures:\n\nInput: READ age, GET name, INPUT score\nOutput: PRINT result, DISPLAY message, WRITE total\nProcessing/Assignment: SET count TO 0, CALCULATE average = sum / count, variable = expression\nSelection: IF (condition) THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF\nIteration: FOR counter FROM start TO end DO ... ENDFOR, WHILE (condition) DO ... ENDWHILE, DO ... WHILE (condition)\nProcedure/Function calls: CALL MyProcedure(argument)\nKeywords should be clear (often capitalized for distinction).\nIndentation is crucial to show blocks of code within loops, selections, etc., enhancing readability.\nComments: Use // or /* ... */ or REM (remark) to add explanations that are not part of the algorithm itself.\n\n\nExample: Pseudocode for finding the largest of two numbers.\n// Algorithm to find the largest of two numbers\nSTART\n    READ num1\n    READ num2\n \n    IF (num1 &gt; num2) THEN\n        DISPLAY num1 + &quot; is larger.&quot;\n    ELSE IF (num2 &gt; num1) THEN\n        DISPLAY num2 + &quot; is larger.&quot;\n    ELSE\n        DISPLAY &quot;Both numbers are equal.&quot;\n    ENDIF\nEND\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Iterations\n\nRecap of Boolean Logic (AND/OR/NOT):\n\nAND: True if all conditions are true. (e.g., age &gt;= 18 AND has_license == TRUE)\nOR: True if at least one condition is true. (e.g., is_weekend == TRUE OR is_holiday == TRUE)\nNOT: Reverses the truth value. (e.g., NOT is_member == TRUE is same as is_member == FALSE)\nTruth Tables are useful for understanding combinations.\nDe Morgan’s Laws (Optional but powerful for simplifying complex conditions):\n\nNOT (A AND B) is equivalent to (NOT A) OR (NOT B)\nNOT (A OR B) is equivalent to (NOT A) AND (NOT B)\n\n\n\n\nProcedures (Functions/Subroutines - Conceptual):\n\nConcept: A self-contained, named block of instructions designed to perform a specific, well-defined task. Procedures can be “called” (or “invoked”) from other parts of an algorithm to execute their task.\nBenefits:\n\nModularity: Helps break down large, complex problems into smaller, simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Each procedure handles one sub-problem.\nReusability: A procedure can be written once and called multiple times with different inputs, avoiding code duplication.\nReadability &amp; Maintainability: Makes algorithms easier to understand by abstracting away details. Changes to a specific task only need to be made within its procedure.\n\n\nDefining a Procedure (Conceptual Pseudocode):\nPROCEDURE ProcedureName (parameter1, parameter2, ...)\n    (Instructions to perform the task)\n    [RETURN value] // Optional: some procedures return a value\nENDPROCEDURE\n\n\nCalling a Procedure (Conceptual Pseudocode):\nCALL ProcedureName (argument1, argument2, ...)\n// or if it returns a value:\n// SET result_variable TO ProcedureName (argument1, argument2, ...)\n\n\n\n\nParameters and Arguments:\n\nParameters: Variables declared in the procedure definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the procedure when it is called. Example: In PROCEDURE Add (num1, num2), num1 and num2 are parameters.\nArguments: The actual values or variables that are passed to a procedure when it is called. Example: In CALL Add (5, 7), 5 and 7 are arguments.\nAnalogy: A recipe (procedure) might say “add amount_of_sugar (parameter)“. When you bake (call), you use “1 cup of sugar” (argument).\nPass-by-value (Conceptual): A copy of the argument’s value is passed to the parameter. Changes to the parameter inside the procedure do not affect the original argument outside the procedure. (Common default).\nPass-by-reference (Conceptual): The procedure gets direct access to the original argument (e.g., its memory location). Changes to the parameter inside the procedure do affect the original argument.\n\n\nSide Effects of Mutation:\n\nMutation: The act of changing the state or value of a variable after it has been created.\nSide Effect: A procedure has a side effect if it modifies some state outside its local environment, other than by returning a value. This includes modifying global variables or variables passed by reference.\nImportance: While sometimes necessary, unintended side effects can make algorithms difficult to understand, trace, and debug because a procedure might change things in unexpected places.\nExample:\n// Global variable\nSET total_items TO 0\n \nPROCEDURE AddItem (item_value)\n    // This procedure has a side effect: it modifies global_total\n    SET total_items TO total_items + item_value\nENDPROCEDURE\n \nCALL AddItem(10) // total_items becomes 10\nCALL AddItem(5)  // total_items becomes 15\nIt’s often preferred for procedures to operate on inputs (parameters) and produce outputs (return values) without other side effects, promoting “functional purity” in some contexts.\n\n\nThe “Three Prizes Problem” (Illustrative Example for Logic/Iteration):\n\nProblem: “You have three distinct prizes (Prize1, Prize2, Prize3) to award to three distinct people (Alice, Bob, Carol). Each person can only receive one prize. List all possible ways to award the prizes.”\nManual Thought Process / Algorithmic Steps:\n\nConsider Prize1: It can be given to Alice, Bob, or Carol (3 choices).\nIF Prize1 goes to Alice:\nTHEN Prize2 can go to Bob or Carol (2 choices).\nIF Prize2 goes to Bob, THEN Prize3 must go to Carol (1 choice). (Alice-Prize1, Bob-Prize2, Carol-Prize3)\nIF Prize2 goes to Carol, THEN Prize3 must go to Bob (1 choice). (Alice-Prize1, Carol-Prize2, Bob-Prize3)\nIF Prize1 goes to Bob:\nTHEN Prize2 can go to Alice or Carol (2 choices).\n… and so on.\n\n\nThis involves careful iteration through possibilities and ensuring constraints (one prize per person) are met. This is a permutation problem P(3,3) = 3! = 6 ways.\nThis problem helps illustrate how one might systematically list possibilities, perhaps using iteration or a decision tree structure in one’s mind.\n\n\n\n\nDistinction between Multiple Separate Iterations vs. Nested Iterations:\n\nMultiple Separate Iterations: Involve two or more loops that execute one after another. The first loop completes all its iterations before the second loop begins.\n\nExample:\n// First loop: Process items in ListA\nFOR each_itemA IN ListA DO\n    DISPLAY itemA\nENDFOR\n \n// Second loop: Process items in ListB (starts after first loop finishes)\nFOR each_itemB IN ListB DO\n    DISPLAY itemB\nENDFOR\n\n\n\nNested Iterations (covered in Week 4): Involve one loop entirely contained within another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each single iteration of the outer loop.\n\n\n\n\nNested Iterations\n\nNested Iterations (Loops inside Loops):\n\nConcept: A control structure where one loop (the “inner loop”) is placed inside the body of another loop (the “outer loop”). The inner loop executes completely for each single iteration of the outer loop.\nStructure Example (Pseudocode):\nFOR i FROM 1 TO OuterLimit DO       // Outer loop\n    (Outer loop statements - execute OuterLimit times)\n    FOR j FROM 1 TO InnerLimit DO   // Inner loop\n        (Inner loop statements - execute InnerLimit times for EACH outer iteration)\n        // Total executions of this block: OuterLimit * InnerLimit\n    ENDFOR\n    (More outer loop statements)\nENDFOR\n\n\nAnalogy:\n\nClock: The hour hand (outer loop) moves from 1 to 12. For each hour, the minute hand (inner loop) moves from 0 to 59 minutes.\nCalendar: Iterating through months of a year (outer loop), and for each month, iterating through its days (inner loop).\nGrid/Table: To process each cell in a grid, you might iterate through each row (outer loop), and for each row, iterate through each column (inner loop).\n\n\nExamples:\n\nPrinting a 3x3 grid of asterisks:\nFOR row FROM 1 TO 3 DO\n    FOR col FROM 1 TO 3 DO\n        PRINT &quot;*&quot; (on the same line)\n    ENDFOR\n    PRINT newline // Move to the next line after each row\nENDFOR\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\nFinding all pairs of students from a class list to form a team of two (order doesn’t matter for the pair itself, but the loops help generate unique pairs).\n\n\n\n\nBirthday Paradox (Conceptual Simulation/Logic):\n\nProblem Statement: In a group of N people, what’s the likelihood that at least two people share the same birthday (day and month)? (It’s surprisingly high for relatively small N).\nComputational Thinking Approach (Manual Simulation Logic):\n\nImagine you have a list of N people’s birthdays.\nTo find a match:\n\nTake the first person’s birthday.\nCompare it with the second person’s birthday. If it matches, you found a pair.\nIf not, compare it with the third person’s birthday, and so on, up to the Nth person.\n(This is the outer loop selecting person i)\n\n\nIf no match was found for the first person, take the second person’s birthday.\nCompare it with the third person’s birthday (no need to compare with the first again, as that was already done).\nContinue comparing with the fourth, …, Nth person.\n(This is the inner loop selecting person j, where j starts from i+1)\n\n\nThis thought process involves a nested comparison:\nFOR i FROM 1 TO N-1 DO  // Select the first person\n    FOR j FROM i+1 TO N DO // Select the second person (must be different from the first)\n        IF (birthday[i] == birthday[j]) THEN\n            DISPLAY &quot;Match found between person &quot; + i + &quot; and person &quot; + j\n            // Could stop or count matches\n        ENDIF\n    ENDFOR\nENDFOR\n\nThe focus here is on the nested iteration logic required to compare all unique pairs.\n\n\n\n\nBinning Data into Ranges:\n\nConcept: Categorizing numerical data into predefined intervals or “bins”.\nExample: Given exam scores [85, 92, 75, 68, 90, 78, 72, 88, 61, 55], bin them into:\n\nA: 80-100\nB: 70-79\nC: 60-69\nD: 50-59\nF: 0-49\n\n\nAlgorithmic Approach (using a single loop over data and IF-ELSEIF for bins):\nDECLARE scores = [85, 92, 75, 68, 90, 78, 72, 88, 61, 55]\nDECLARE countA = 0, countB = 0, countC = 0, countD = 0, countF = 0\n \nFOR each score IN scores DO\n    IF (score &gt;= 80 AND score &lt;= 100) THEN\n        INCREMENT countA\n    ELSE IF (score &gt;= 70 AND score &lt;= 79) THEN\n        INCREMENT countB\n    ELSE IF (score &gt;= 60 AND score &lt;= 69) THEN\n        INCREMENT countC\n    ELSE IF (score &gt;= 50 AND score &lt;= 59) THEN\n        INCREMENT countD\n    ELSE IF (score &gt;= 0 AND score &lt;= 49) THEN\n        INCREMENT countF\n    ENDIF\nENDFOR\n \nDISPLAY &quot;Grade A: &quot; + countA\nDISPLAY &quot;Grade B: &quot; + countB\n// ... and so on\n\nWhile this example uses a single loop over the data items, the process of checking against multiple bin conditions is a form of case analysis. Nested loops could be used if, for instance, you had a list of bin definitions and iterated through bins for each score, but the IF-ELSEIF is more direct here.\n\n\n\n\nComplexity Considerations (Introduction - Algorithmic Efficiency):\n\nConcept: An informal understanding of how the number of steps an algorithm takes (its “running time”) or the amount of memory it uses grows as the size of its input grows.\nWhy it matters: An algorithm that is efficient will run faster and use less memory, especially for large inputs. An inefficient algorithm might become too slow to be useful.\nNested Loops Impact: Nested loops are a common way algorithms become less efficient.\n\nIf an outer loop runs N times, and for each of those N times, an inner loop also runs N times, then the statements inside the inner loop will execute N * N = N² times.\nExample: The Birthday Paradox simulation logic above has an outer loop that runs roughly N times and an inner loop that also runs roughly N times. This leads to approximately N² comparisons. If N=100 people, that’s about 100*100 = 10,000 comparisons. If N=1000, it’s 1,000,000 comparisons. The work grows much faster than N.\n\n\nSimple Examples of “Order”:\n\nAlgorithm with one loop iterating N times: Roughly N steps. We might say it’s “Order N”.\nAlgorithm with two nested loops, each iterating N times: Roughly N² steps. “Order N-squared”.\n\n\nGoal: Generally, we prefer algorithms with a lower order of growth (e.g., Order N is better than Order N-squared for large N). This is a very early, intuitive introduction to a concept formally known as “Big O notation.”\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\nIntroduction to Collections/Data Structures:\n\nWhy we need them: Algorithms often need to work with groups of related data items. Data structures provide ways to organize, store, and manage these collections efficiently.\nAnalogy: A shopping list helps organize items you need to buy. A phone book organizes contacts. A library’s card catalog organizes books.\n\n\nLists (Arrays/Sequences - Conceptual):\n\nDefinition: A list is an ordered collection of items, called elements. The order of elements is preserved.\nProperties:\n\nOrdered: Elements are stored in a specific sequence. The position of each element matters.\nIndexed: Each element in a list can be accessed by its position, called an index. Indices usually start from 0 (for the first element) or 1. Example: If my_list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;], then my_list[0] could be “apple” and my_list[1] could be “banana”.\nDynamic Size (Conceptual): For computational thinking, we often imagine lists as being flexible; they can grow when new items are added or shrink when items are removed. (Some programming languages have fixed-size arrays, while others have dynamic lists/arrays).\nElement Types: A list can contain items of the same type (e.g., a list of numbers) or sometimes mixed types (e.g., a list containing a number, some text, and a true/false value), though often lists of the same type are easier to reason about.\n\n\n\n\nCommon List Operations (Conceptual - how one would manually think about them):\n\nCreating a list: Defining a new list with some initial items. E.g., SET shopping_list TO [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;].\nAccessing elements: Getting the value of an item at a specific index. E.g., “What is the second item on my shopping list?” → Access shopping_list[1] (if 0-indexed).\nUpdating elements: Changing the value of an item at a specific index. E.g., “Change the second item on my shopping list from ‘eggs’ to ‘butter’.” → SET shopping_list[1] TO &quot;butter&quot;.\nAdding elements:\n\nAppend: Adding a new item to the end of the list. E.g., “Add ‘cheese’ to my shopping list.”\nInsert: Adding a new item at a specific position/index in the list, shifting subsequent items. E.g., “Insert ‘juice’ as the new second item.”\n\n\nRemoving elements:\n\nRemove from end: Deleting the last item.\nRemove at index: Deleting the item at a specific position, shifting subsequent items.\n\n\nFinding the length: Determining how many items are currently in the list. E.g., “How many items are on my shopping list?”\nIterating through a list: Processing each element in the list one by one, from the first to the last. This is typically done using a loop.\nFOR EACH item IN my_list DO\n    // Do something with &#039;item&#039;\n    DISPLAY item\nENDFOR\n\n\n\nUsing Lists to Store Dynamic Data:\n\nExamples:\n\nStoring a list of scores entered by a user, where you don’t know beforehand how many scores will be entered.\nKeeping track of tasks in a to-do list; tasks can be added or removed.\nManaging a queue of customers waiting for service.\n\n\n\n\nSearching in a List (Linear Search - Manual Walkthrough):\n\nProblem: Given a list and a target value, determine if the target value exists in the list. If it does, optionally return its position (index).\nAlgorithm (Linear Search):\n\nSTART with the first item in the list (e.g., at index 0).\nCOMPARE the current item with the target value.\nIF they are the same, THEN the target is found. STOP and report “Found” (and its index).\nIF they are not the same, MOVE to the next item in the list.\nIF there are no more items to check (i.e., you’ve reached the end of the list), THEN the target is not in the list. STOP and report “Not found”.\n\n\nTrace Example: my_list = [10, 30, 5, 15, 20], target = 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent ItemIndexCompare with 15?Result100NoContinue301NoContinue52NoContinue153YesFound at index 3\n\n\n\nSorting a List (Introduction):\n\nWhy sort?: Arranging items in a list into a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending for numbers, alphabetical for text).\nBenefits: Makes searching for items much faster (e.g., enabling binary search), helps in identifying duplicates, makes data easier to read and analyze, useful for finding min/max values.\n\n\nInsertion Sort (Manual Walkthrough):\n\nConcept: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements and, for each element, it inserts it into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the list.\nAnalogy: How many people sort a hand of playing cards. You pick up cards one by one. For each new card, you insert it into the correct position relative to the cards you are already holding (which are already sorted).\nAlgorithm Steps (High-level for manual trace):\n\nStart with the second element of the list (assume the first element by itself is a “sorted sublist” of one).\nPick the current element (let’s call it key).\nCompare key with the elements in the sorted sublist to its left, moving from right to left.\nWhile an element in the sorted sublist is greater than key, shift that element one position to the right to make space.\nInsert key into the now-empty slot where it belongs.\nRepeat steps 2-5 for all remaining unsorted elements.\n\n\nDetailed Trace: Example list [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]\n\nInitial: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8] (Sorted part considered [5])\nPass 1 (consider element 1):\n\nkey = 1. Compare 1 with 5. 5 &gt; 1, so shift 5 right: [_, 5, 4, 2, 8]\nInsert 1: [1, 5, 4, 2, 8] (Sorted part: [1, 5])\n\n\nPass 2 (consider element 4):\n\nkey = 4. Compare 4 with 5. 5 &gt; 4, so shift 5 right: [1, _, 5, 2, 8]\nCompare 4 with 1. 1 &lt; 4, so insert 4 in the empty slot: [1, 4, 5, 2, 8] (Sorted part: [1, 4, 5])\n\n\nPass 3 (consider element 2):\n\nkey = 2. Compare 2 with 5. 5 &gt; 2, shift 5: [1, 4, _, 5, 8]\nCompare 2 with 4. 4 &gt; 2, shift 4: [1, _, 4, 5, 8]\nCompare 2 with 1. 1 &lt; 2, so insert 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8] (Sorted part: [1, 2, 4, 5])\n\n\nPass 4 (consider element 8):\n\nkey = 8. Compare 8 with 5. 5 &lt; 8. No shifts needed, 8 is in place relative to sorted part.\nList remains: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8] (Sorted part: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8])\n\n\nList is now sorted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables &amp; Dictionaries\n\nLimitations of Lists for Certain Tasks:\n\nSearching for a specific item in an unsorted list requires checking each item one by one (linear search), which can be slow for long lists.\nAccessing items is based on numerical position (index). If you want to access an item based on a non-numerical identifier (e.g., finding a person’s phone number by their name), lists are not ideal.\n\n\nTables (Conceptual - Key-Value Pairs):\n\nConcept: A data structure that stores a collection of items, where each item consists of a unique key and an associated value. The key is used to look up the value.\nAnalogy:\n\nA physical dictionary: The word (key) is used to look up its definition (value).\nA phone book: A person’s name (key) is used to find their phone number (value).\nStudent records: Student ID (key) maps to a record containing all student details (value).\n\n\nKey Properties:\n\nKeys must be unique within the table. Each key maps to exactly one value.\nKeys are used for efficient retrieval of their associated values.\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries (Associative Arrays, Hash Maps, Maps - Conceptual):\n\nThese are common terms for the data structure that implements the key-value table concept in computational systems.\nOperations (Conceptual - how one would manually think about them):\n\nAdding a new key-value pair: STORE key_A WITH value_1 IN my_dictionary. Example: my_dictionary[&quot;apple&quot;] = &quot;a red fruit&quot;.\nAccessing a value: GET value FOR key_A FROM my_dictionary. Example: definition = my_dictionary[&quot;apple&quot;].\nUpdating a value: If the key already exists, assign a new value to it. UPDATE key_A WITH new_value_1 IN my_dictionary. Example: my_dictionary[&quot;apple&quot;] = &quot;a delicious red fruit&quot;.\nRemoving a key-value pair: REMOVE entry FOR key_A FROM my_dictionary.\nChecking if a key exists: “Does my_dictionary contain key_A?”\nIterating: You can iterate through all keys, all values, or all key-value pairs.\n\n\n\n\nHashing Concepts (Simplified Intuition):\n\nProblem: If you have many key-value pairs, how do you quickly find the value for a given key without checking every single key (like in a list)?\nHash Function: A special function that takes a key as input and computes a numerical value called a “hash code” or simply “hash”. This hash code is then often used to determine an index or position where the key-value pair should be stored in memory (e.g., in an array).\nAnalogy: Imagine a large filing cabinet with many drawers. A hash function is like a rule that tells you which drawer to look in based on the key (e.g., for a name, the first letter might tell you the drawer). This is much faster than opening every drawer.\nIdeal Hash Function:\n\nDeterministic: The same key always produces the same hash code.\nUniform Distribution: Spreads keys out evenly across possible hash codes/indices to minimize collisions.\n\n\nCollisions: Occur when two different keys produce the same hash code (i.e., they are mapped to the same storage location/index).\n\nBrief mention: This is a common issue. Systems have strategies to handle collisions (e.g., storing multiple items at that location in a list, or finding another nearby empty spot). A deep dive into collision resolution is not needed here, just the awareness.\n\n\nHow it helps dictionaries: By using a hash function, dictionaries can typically store and retrieve values very quickly, often in nearly constant time on average, regardless of the number of items.\n\n\nDictionary-Based Counting:\n\nProblem: Efficiently count the frequency of occurrence of each unique item in a collection (e.g., words in a text, numbers in a list).\nExample: Count occurrences of each fruit in the list [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;].\nAlgorithm using a dictionary (e.g., fruit_counts):\n\nInitialize an empty dictionary: fruit_counts = {}.\nIterate through the list of fruits. For each fruit:\na.  IF fruit IS A KEY IN fruit_counts THEN (check if we’ve seen this fruit before)\nb.    INCREMENT the value (count) associated with fruit_counts[fruit].\nc.  ELSE (it’s the first time we’ve seen this fruit)\nd.    ADD fruit AS A NEW KEY TO fruit_counts WITH VALUE 1.\n\n\nTrace:\n\napple: fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 1}\norange: fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 1, &quot;orange&quot;: 1}\napple: fruit_counts[&quot;apple&quot;] becomes 2. fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 2, &quot;orange&quot;: 1}\nbanana: fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 2, &quot;orange&quot;: 1, &quot;banana&quot;: 1}\norange: fruit_counts[&quot;orange&quot;] becomes 2. fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 2, &quot;orange&quot;: 2, &quot;banana&quot;: 1}\napple: fruit_counts[&quot;apple&quot;] becomes 3. fruit_counts = {&quot;apple&quot;: 3, &quot;orange&quot;: 2, &quot;banana&quot;: 1}\n\n\nResult: {&quot;apple&quot;: 3, &quot;orange&quot;: 2, &quot;banana&quot;: 1}.\n\n\nWhen to use Dictionaries vs. Lists:\n\nLists: Use when the order of items is important, and you primarily access items by their numerical position (index). Good for sequences of things.\nDictionaries: Use when you need to store and retrieve items based on a unique identifier (key) and the order of items is not the primary concern. Excellent for fast lookups, associations, and counting.\n\n\n\n\nGraphs &amp; Matrices\n\nIntroduction to Graphs (Recap/Introduction):\n\nDefinition: A graph G=(V,E) is a structure made of a set of vertices (V) (also called nodes or points) and a set of edges (E) (also called links or arcs) that connect pairs of vertices.\nPurpose: Graphs are used to model relationships and connections between objects or entities.\nReal-world Examples:\n\nSocial networks: People are vertices, friendships/connections are edges.\nRoad maps: Cities are vertices, roads between them are edges.\nThe internet: Web pages are vertices, hyperlinks are directed edges.\nTask dependencies in a project: Tasks are vertices, an edge from task A to task B means A must be completed before B.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Graphs (Brief Review/Introduction):\n\nUndirected Graph: Edges have no direction (e.g., a friendship between A and B is the same as B and A).\nDirected Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction (e.g., a one-way street, a hyperlink from page A to page B).\nWeighted Graph: Each edge has an associated numerical value called a weight (e.g., distance between cities, cost of a flight).\nUnweighted Graph: Edges do not have weights (or all weights are implicitly 1).\n\n\nRepresenting Relationships with Graphs:\n\nThink about a scenario: “Friendship network”. Vertices = people. Edge exists if two people are friends.\nScenario: “Course prerequisites”. Vertices = courses. Directed edge from Course A to Course B if A is a prerequisite for B.\n\n\nMatrix Representations of Graphs:\n\nAdjacency Matrix:\n\nDefinition: A square matrix A of size V x V (where V is the number of vertices). The rows and columns are typically labeled by the vertices.\nFor an unweighted graph: A[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge connecting vertex i to vertex j. A[i][j] = 0 if there is no direct edge.\nFor a directed graph, A[i][j] = 1 means an edge from i to j.\nFor an undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric (i.e., A[i][j] = A[j][i]).\nIf loops (edges from a vertex to itself) are allowed, A[i][i] can be 1.\nExample: Graph: Vertices {1,2,3}. Edges: (1,2), (2,3), (1,3) (undirected)\nAdjacency Matrix:\n  1 2 3\n1[0 1 1]\n2[1 0 1]\n3[1 1 0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjacency List Representation of Graphs:\n\nDefinition: An array (or list) of lists. For each vertex v, AdjacencyList[v] stores a list of all vertices that are adjacent to v (i.e., directly connected by an edge).\nFor weighted graphs, the list can store pairs: (adjacent_vertex, weight_of_edge).\nExample (same graph as above): Vertices {1,2,3}. Edges: (1,2), (2,3), (1,3)\nAdjacency List:\n1: [2, 3]\n2: [1, 3]\n3: [1, 2]\n\n\nAdjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List:\n\nSpace Usage:\n\nMatrix: Requires V2 space. If the graph has many vertices but few edges (sparse graph), most of the matrix will be zeros, wasting space.\nList: Requires space proportional to V + E (number of vertices + number of edges). More space-efficient for sparse graphs.\n\n\nTime for Common Operations:\n\nCheck if an edge exists between vertex u and v:\n\nMatrix: O(1) - just look up Matrix[u][v].\nList: O(degree(u)) in the worst case - need to scan the list for u.\n\n\nFind all neighbors of a vertex u:\n\nMatrix: O(V) - need to scan the entire row for u.\nList: O(degree(u)) - just iterate through the list for u.\n\n\nAdding an edge: Matrix O(1). List O(1) (add to end of list).\nRemoving an edge: Matrix O(1). List O(degree(u)) or O(degree(v)).\n\n\nPreference:\n\nAdjacency Matrix: Better for dense graphs (many edges, E approaching V2) or when you need to frequently and quickly check for specific edges.\nAdjacency List: Better for sparse graphs (few edges, E closer to V), which are common in many real-world scenarios. Most graph algorithms run more efficiently with adjacency lists on sparse graphs.\n\n\n\n\nSimple Graph Algorithms (Conceptual Walkthroughs):\n\nFinding the Degree of a Vertex (Undirected Graph):\n\nUsing Adjacency Matrix: Sum all the 1s in the row (or column) corresponding to that vertex.\nUsing Adjacency List: Count the number of elements in the list for that vertex.\n\n\nChecking if a Graph is Connected (Undirected Graph - Intuitive Idea):\n\nConcept: A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of distinct vertices.\nManual Check (Small Graphs): Start at any vertex. Can you “walk” along edges to reach every other vertex? If yes for all starting vertices, it’s connected.\nThis introduces the idea of graph traversal (like BFS or DFS, which are formal algorithms for this, possibly covered later or in BSMA1001). The core idea is systematically exploring the graph.\n\n\nCounting Number of Edges:\n\nUsing Adjacency Matrix (Undirected): Sum all the 1s in the matrix and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice, e.g., A[i][j] and A[j][i]). For directed, just sum all 1s.\nUsing Adjacency List (Undirected): Sum the lengths of all the adjacency lists and divide by 2. For directed, sum the lengths of all lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjacency Matrices (Deeper Dive / Applications)\n\nReview Adjacency Matrix:\n\nStructure: V x V matrix, A[i][j] indicates connection from i to j.\nSymmetry for undirected graphs.\n\n\nStoring Weighted Edges in Adjacency Matrix:\n\nModification: Instead of just 0 (no edge) or 1 (edge exists), the cell A[i][j] stores the actual weight w_ij of the edge from vertex i to vertex j.\nIf no edge exists between i and j:\n\nStore 0: If edge weights are strictly positive. However, this can be ambiguous if an edge could legitimately have a weight of 0.\nStore a special value like ∞ (infinity) or a very large number: Often used in shortest path algorithms where you want to represent non-existent paths as having infinite cost initially.\nStore a sentinel value like -1 (if weights are non-negative).\n\n\nExample: A road network graph where vertices are cities and edge weights are distances.\nGraph: A —(10km)⇒ B, B —(5km)⇒ C, A —(20km)⇒ C\nWeighted Adjacency Matrix (using 0 for no direct path, assuming positive weights):\n  A  B  C\nA[0 10 20]\nB[0  0  5]  // Assuming directed or A-B already listed\nC[0  0  0]\n\nIf undirected and A-B means B-A:\n  A  B  C\nA[0 10 20]\nB[10 0  5]\nC[20 5  0]\n\n\n\n\nExploring Edge-Labelled Graphs (Conceptually):\n\nConcept: Sometimes, edges have qualitative attributes (labels or types) in addition to or instead of numerical weights.\nExample: A transportation network where an edge between cities could be labeled “Train,” “Bus,” or “Flight,” and each might have a different associated cost or time (weight).\nRepresenting with Adjacency Matrix (Challenges/Approaches):\n\nStandard adjacency matrix is designed for a single numerical value (0/1 or weight).\nMultiple Matrices: If there’s a small, fixed set of labels, you could have a separate adjacency matrix for each label type (e.g., Matrix_Train, Matrix_Bus). Matrix_Train[i][j] = 1 if a train link exists.\nComplex Cell Values: The cell A[i][j] could store a pointer or reference to a list or structure containing multiple pieces of information about the edge(s) between i and j (e.g., [(label:&quot;Train&quot;, weight:50), (label:&quot;Bus&quot;, weight:30)]). This makes the matrix cells more complex than simple numbers.\nAdjacency lists are often more naturally suited for storing rich information about edges, as the list elements can easily be complex objects or structures.\n\n\n\n\nMemory Usage Trade-offs (Revisited with Examples):\n\nAdjacency Matrix: Always V2 entries.\n\nExample 1 (Sparse): 5 vertices, 4 edges. Matrix uses 5*5 = 25 cells.\nExample 2 (Dense/Complete K5): 5 vertices, 10 edges. Matrix uses 5*5 = 25 cells.\nExample 3 (Larger Sparse): 100 vertices, 200 edges. Matrix uses 100*100 = 10,000 cells.\n\n\nAdjacency List: V lists, total number of elements in all lists is 2E for undirected, E for directed.\n\nExample 1 (Sparse): 5 lists. Total elements ~2*4 = 8. (Plus list overhead).\nExample 2 (Dense/Complete K5): 5 lists. Total elements ~2*10 = 20.\nExample 3 (Larger Sparse): 100 lists. Total elements ~2*200 = 400.\n\n\nConclusion: For graphs with many vertices but relatively few edges (sparse), adjacency lists save significant memory compared to adjacency matrices.\n\n\nPowers of Adjacency Matrix (Ak) (for unweighted graphs):\n\nLet A be the adjacency matrix of an unweighted graph (0s and 1s).\nA2 = A * A (matrix multiplication). The entry (A^2)[i][j] represents the number of distinct paths of length exactly 2 from vertex i to vertex j.\n\nIntuition: (A^2)[i][j] = Σ (A[i][k] * A[k][j]) for all k. A term A[i][k] * A[k][j] is 1 if there’s an edge from i to k AND an edge from k to j (i.e., a path i-k-j). Summing these counts paths through all possible intermediaries k.\n\n\nAk[i][j]: The entry (A^k)[i][j] represents the number of distinct paths of length exactly k from vertex i to vertex j.\nExample: For a simple graph, calculate A and A2.\nGraph: 1-2, 2-3\nA =\n  1 2 3\n1[0 1 0]\n2[1 0 1]\n3[0 1 0]\n\nA2 =\n  1 2 3\n1[1 0 1]  // 1-&gt;2-&gt;1 (len 2), 1-&gt;2-&gt;3 (len 2)\n2[0 2 0]  // 2-&gt;1-&gt;2 (len 2), 2-&gt;3-&gt;2 (len 2)\n3[1 0 1]  // 3-&gt;2-&gt;1 (len 2), 3-&gt;2-&gt;3 (len 2)\n\nInterpretation: (A2)[1][3] = 1 means there is 1 path of length 2 from vertex 1 to 3 (which is 1-2-3). (A2)[1][1] = 1 means 1 path of length 2 from 1 to 1 (1-2-1).\n\n\nReachability/Transitive Closure (Conceptual Introduction):\n\nQuestion: Can vertex i reach vertex j through any path of any length?\nTransitive Closure Matrix (R): R[i][j] = 1 if j is reachable from i, and 0 otherwise.\nOne way to think about it: If there’s a path from i to j, it must have length 1, or 2, or …, or V-1 (for simple paths without cycles in a graph with V vertices).\nSo, reachability can be related to checking A[i][j] &gt; 0 OR (A^2)[i][j] &gt; 0 … OR (A^(V-1))[i][j] &gt; 0.\nMore formally, let B = I + A + A2 + … + AV-1 (where I is the identity matrix). Then R[i][j] = 1 if B[i][j] &gt; 0.\nOther algorithms like Floyd-Warshall or running BFS/DFS from each vertex can also determine reachability and compute the transitive closure. This is just an introduction to the concept via matrix powers.\n\n\n\n\nBacktracking &amp; Trees\n\nIntroduction to Trees (Data Structure):\n\nDefinition: A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Unlike general graphs, trees are characterized by:\n\nA designated root node (unless the tree is empty).\nEvery node (except the root) has exactly one parent node.\nThere are no cycles in a tree.\nThere is a unique path from the root to any other node.\n\n\nTerminology:\n\nRoot: The topmost node of the tree, which has no parent.\nParent: A node that is connected to other nodes below it (its children).\nChild: A node that is connected to a node above it (its parent).\nSiblings: Nodes that share the same parent.\nLeaf Node (External Node): A node that has no children.\nInternal Node (Non-Leaf Node): A node that has at least one child.\nSubtree: A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.\nDepth of a node: The number of edges on the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root is 0.\nHeight of a tree: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The height of an empty tree is often defined as -1, and a tree with a single node has height 0.\n\n\nBinary Trees: A specific type of tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\nExamples:\n\nFamily trees (ancestors and descendants).\nOrganizational charts (hierarchy of employees).\nFile system directory structures (folders containing files and subfolders).\nDecision trees (used in Week 12).\n\n\n\n\nRecursion (Conceptual Introduction/Revisit):\n\nDefinition: A problem-solving technique where a procedure or function calls itself, directly or indirectly, to solve smaller, self-similar subproblems.\nKey Components:\n\nBase Case(s): One or more simple cases of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion. This is crucial to prevent infinite recursion.\nRecursive Step: The part of the procedure where it calls itself with modified input, moving closer to a base case. The problem is broken down into smaller versions of itself.\n\n\nAnalogy: Russian nesting dolls (each doll contains a smaller version of itself). A function to calculate factorial: factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1), with base case factorial(0) = 1.\nHow it relates to trees: Many tree operations are naturally defined and implemented recursively because of the tree’s hierarchical structure. For example, to process a tree, you might process the root, then recursively process its left subtree and its right subtree.\n\n\nTree Traversal (Conceptual, relating to DFS):\n\nDefinition: The process of systematically visiting (e.g., reading or processing the data in) each node in a tree exactly once.\nDepth-First Search (DFS) Idea on Trees: Explores as far down as possible along each branch before backtracking. For trees, this is implemented by various traversal orders:\n\nPre-order Traversal (Root-Left-Right):\n\nVisit/Process the current node (Root).\nRecursively traverse the left subtree.\nRecursively traverse the right subtree.\n\n\nUse: Copying a tree, creating a prefix expression from an expression tree.\n\n\nIn-order Traversal (Left-Root-Right - primarily for Binary Trees):\n\nRecursively traverse the left subtree.\nVisit/Process the current node (Root).\nRecursively traverse the right subtree.\n\n\nUse: For binary search trees, this traversal visits nodes in ascending order.\n\n\nPost-order Traversal (Left-Right-Root):\n\nRecursively traverse the left subtree.\nRecursively traverse the right subtree.\nVisit/Process the current node (Root).\n\n\nUse: Deleting nodes in a tree (process children before parent), calculating the size of subtrees.\n\n\n\n\nManual Trace Example: Consider a binary tree:\n      A\n     / \\\n    B   C\n   / \\\n  D   E\n\n\nPre-order: A, B, D, E, C\nIn-order: D, B, E, A, C\nPost-order: D, E, B, C, A\n\n\n\n\nBacktracking:\n\nConcept: A systematic algorithmic technique, often implemented using recursion, for solving problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time. If an incremental choice leads to a dead end or violates problem constraints, the algorithm “backtracks” by undoing the previous choice and trying an alternative.\nAnalogy: Finding your way through a maze. You explore one path. If you hit a dead end, you retrace your steps (backtrack) to the last junction where you had a choice of paths, and then try a different path.\nCore Idea:\n\nChoose: Make a choice at the current decision point.\nExplore: Recursively try to solve the problem with the choice made.\nIf solution found, return success.\nIf no solution found from current choice (dead end), Undo the choice (backtrack) and try another alternative.\n\n\n\n\nSolving Puzzles via Backtracking (Manual Walkthroughs):\n\nN-Queens Problem (Conceptual for 4-Queens):\n\nProblem: Place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (i.e., no two queens on the same row, column, or diagonal).\nBacktracking Application:\n\nStart by trying to place a queen in the first column of the first row.\nMove to the next row, try to place a queen in the first “safe” column (not attacked by previously placed queens).\nIf a safe column is found, place the queen and move to the next row.\nIf no safe column is found in the current row, backtrack to the previous row, remove the queen placed there, and try placing it in the next safe column in that previous row.\nRepeat until all N queens are placed or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\n\nIllustrative Steps for 4-Queens:\n\nRow 1: Place Queen at (1,1).\nRow 2: Try (2,1) - conflict. Try (2,2) - conflict. Try (2,3) - OK. Place Queen at (2,3).\nRow 3: Try (3,1) - conflict. Try (3,2) - OK. Place Queen at (3,2).\nRow 4: Try (4,1)-conflict, (4,2)-conflict, (4,3)-conflict, (4,4)-conflict. No place. Backtrack!\nRow 3: Remove Queen from (3,2). Try next safe: (3,4) - conflict. No more options. Backtrack!\nRow 2: Remove Queen from (2,3). Try next safe: (2,4) - OK. Place Queen at (2,4).\nRow 3: Try (3,1) - OK. Place Queen at (3,1).\nRow 4: Try (4,2) - conflict. Try (4,3) - OK. Place Queen at (4,3). Solution found: [(1,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)] (one possible solution).\n\n\n\n\nSudoku Solving (Conceptual):\n\nProblem: Fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all digits from 1 to 9.\nBacktracking Application:\n\nFind an empty cell.\nTry filling it with a digit from 1 to 9.\nCheck if this digit is valid (doesn’t violate Sudoku rules for that row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).\nIf valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat recursively.\nIf the digit is not valid, or if a later recursive call returns “no solution”, then backtrack: erase the digit and try the next possible digit for the current cell.\nIf all digits 1-9 have been tried for a cell and none lead to a solution, return “no solution” to the previous call.\n\n\n\n\nPathfinding in a Maze:\n\nProblem: Find a path from a start point to an end point in a maze.\nBacktracking Application:\n\nStart at the entry point. Mark current cell as visited.\nIF current cell is the exit, THEN solution found.\nELSE, for each unvisited neighboring cell:\na.  Move to that neighbor.\nb.  Recursively try to find a path from this new cell.\nc.  IF a path is found from the neighbor, THEN solution found.\nd.  ELSE (path not found from neighbor), “unmark” the neighbor (backtrack - this path was a dead end) and try another neighbor from the original cell.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Pseudocode Structure for Backtracking:\nFUNCTION CanSolve(problem_state)\n    IF problem_state is a final success_state THEN\n        RETURN TRUE\n    ENDIF\n \n    FOR EACH possible_next_step FROM problem_state\n        IF is_valid_step(possible_next_step) THEN\n            apply_step_to_reach(new_state)\n            IF CanSolve(new_state) THEN  // Recursive call\n                RETURN TRUE\n            ENDIF\n            undo_step_to_revert_to(problem_state) // Backtrack\n        ENDIF\n    ENDFOR\n    RETURN FALSE // No move from this state leads to a solution\nENDFUNCTION\n\n\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Concepts (Conceptual Introduction)\n\nLimitations of Procedural Approach for Complex Systems:\n\nIn purely procedural programming (sequences of instructions, procedures/functions), as programs grow larger and more complex, managing shared data across many functions can become difficult.\nIt can be harder to model real-world entities that have both properties (data) and actions (behavior) in a cohesive way. Data and the functions that operate on that data might be loosely connected.\n\n\nCore Idea of Object-Oriented Thinking:\n\nInstead of focusing primarily on procedures, object-oriented thinking focuses on “objects” as the primary building blocks.\nAn object is a self-contained unit that bundles together:\n\nData (called attributes or properties) that describe its state.\nBehavior (called methods or functions) that define what it can do or what can be done to it. These methods typically operate on the object’s own data.\n\n\nAnalogy:\n\nReal-world “car” object: Attributes: color, make, model, current speed, fuel level. Behaviors: startEngine(), stopEngine(), accelerate(), brake().\nReal-world “dog” object: Attributes: breed, age, name. Behaviors: bark(), eat(), sleep().\n\n\n\n\nClasses:\n\nConcept: A blueprint, template, or a user-defined data type for creating objects. It defines the common structure (what attributes its objects will have) and behavior (what methods its objects can perform).\nAnalogy: A cookie cutter is a class; it defines the shape of cookies. The actual cookies made from it are objects. A building blueprint is a class; the buildings constructed from it are objects.\n\n\nObjects (Instances of a Class):\n\nConcept: A specific, concrete realization (or instance) of a class. When an object is created from a class, it gets its own set of attribute values (its state). It shares the method definitions with other objects of the same class.\nExample: If Dog is a class, then myDogFido (an object) might have name=&quot;Fido&quot;, breed=&quot;Labrador&quot;, and myOtherDogBuddy (another object) might have name=&quot;Buddy&quot;, breed=&quot;Poodle&quot;. Both can bark().\n\n\nAttributes (Properties/Fields/Instance Variables):\n\nThese are the data elements that belong to an object. They define the state or characteristics of an object.\nExample: For a Student class, attributes could be studentID, name, major, gpa. Each Student object would have its own values for these attributes.\n\n\nMethods (Behaviors/Functions/Instance Methods):\n\nThese are the functions or procedures that are defined within a class and operate on the data (attributes) of objects of that class. They define what an object can do.\nExample: For a Student class, methods could be enrollInCourse(course_name), calculateGPA(), getStudentName().\n\n\nConstructors:\n\nConcept: A special type of method within a class that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created (instantiated).\nPurpose: Its primary role is to initialize the attributes of the newly created object, ensuring it starts in a valid state.\nExample: When creating a Student object like newStudent = CREATE_OBJECT Student(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;S1001&quot;), the Student constructor would take “Alice” and “S1001” and assign them to the new object’s name and studentID attributes.\n\n\nEncapsulation:\n\nConcept: One of the fundamental principles of OOP. It means bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data together within a single unit (the object/class).\nInformation Hiding: A key part of encapsulation. It involves restricting direct access to some of an object’s internal data (attributes) from outside the object. Instead, access (to read or modify) is often provided through specific methods (getters and setters, or other public methods).\nBenefits:\n\nProtects an object’s internal state from accidental or incorrect modification from outside.\nMakes code more modular: The internal implementation of an object can be changed without affecting other parts of the program, as long as the public interface (methods) remains the same.\nHides complexity: Users of an object only need to know what it does (its methods), not necessarily how it does it.\n\n\nAnalogy: A car driver uses the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes (public methods/interface) to control the car. They don’t need to directly manipulate the engine’s internal components (hidden data/implementation).\n\n\nOther OO Concepts (Brief Mention - No Deep Dive for CT focus):\n\nInheritance: A mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) can acquire (inherit) the properties (attributes and methods) of an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and creates an “is-a” relationship (e.g., an ElectricCar is a type of Car).\nPolymorphism (“Many Forms”): The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in ways specific to their class. (e.g., if Circle and Square classes both have a draw() method, calling draw() on a Circle object behaves differently than on a Square object).\n\n\nFocus for CT: Understanding how these concepts help in organizing complex problems by modeling real-world or conceptual entities as self-contained objects with their own data and behaviors, making the system easier to design, understand, and maintain.\n\n\nConcurrency (Conceptual Introduction)\n\nSequential vs. Concurrent Execution:\n\nSequential Execution: Instructions or tasks are performed one after another, in a single sequence. Only one task is active at any given moment.\nConcurrent Execution: Multiple tasks appear to be progressing or executing at the same time.\n\nOn a single CPU/core system, this is achieved by interleaving the execution of tasks (the CPU rapidly switches between tasks). This is often called multitasking or logical concurrency.\nOn a multi-CPU/core system, tasks can run in true parallelism, with different tasks executing simultaneously on different cores.\n\n\nAnalogy:\n\nSequential: A person reading one book from start to finish before starting another.\nConcurrent (interleaved): A chef preparing a meal by switching between chopping vegetables, stirring a pot, and checking the oven.\nParallel: Multiple chefs each working on a different dish simultaneously in a large kitchen.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Concurrency?:\n\nResponsiveness: In applications with user interfaces, concurrency allows the program to remain responsive to user input (e.g., mouse clicks) while performing a long-running task in the background (e.g., downloading a file, complex calculation).\nPerformance/Speedup: By dividing a large task into sub-tasks that can run in parallel on multi-core processors, the overall time to complete the task can be reduced.\nResource Utilization: Allows a CPU to do other work while one task is waiting for a slow operation (like reading from a disk or network).\nModeling Real-World Systems: Many real-world systems are inherently concurrent (e.g., multiple users accessing a website, multiple ATMs connected to a bank).\n\n\nProcesses vs. Threads (Simplified for CT):\n\nProcess: An instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process typically has its own independent memory space, meaning data is not directly shared between processes. (Think of separate applications running on your computer, like a web browser and a word processor).\nThread: A lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and they share the same memory space (meaning they can access and modify the same data). This makes communication between threads easier but also introduces risks.\n\n\nRemote Procedure Calls (RPC):\n\nConcept: A mechanism that allows a procedure (function or method) in one program (or process) to be executed by another program (or process), which may be located on a different computer connected via a network.\nHow it works (simplified): The calling program (client) makes a request that looks like a normal local procedure call. The RPC system handles the underlying network communication to send the request and parameters to the remote program (server), execute the procedure there, and return the results to the client.\nAnalogy: Ordering food via a food delivery app. You (client) make a request (call a “place order” procedure). The app (RPC system) sends it to the restaurant (server). The restaurant processes it. The app brings you the result (food). You don’t directly interact with the restaurant’s kitchen.\n\n\nChallenges in Concurrency: When multiple tasks/threads access shared resources or data, problems can arise.\n\nRace Conditions:\n\nDefinition: A situation where the outcome of a computation depends on the unpredictable timing or interleaving of operations from multiple threads or processes accessing shared data. The “race” is about which thread gets to access/modify the data first.\nExample: Two threads (T1, T2) want to increment a shared counter C (initially 0).\n\nT1 reads C (gets 0).\nT2 reads C (gets 0).\nT1 calculates C+1 (is 1).\nT2 calculates C+1 (is 1).\nT1 writes 1 to C. (C is now 1).\nT2 writes 1 to C. (C is still 1).\nThe correct result should be 2, but due to interleaving, it’s 1.\n\n\nThis illustrates how shared data can become inconsistent.\n\n\nSynchronization Primitives (to manage shared access):\n\nLocks (Mutexes - MUTual EXclusion):\n\nConcept: A synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a specific shared resource or execute a particular section of code (called a “critical section”) at any given time.\nOperation: A thread must “acquire” or “obtain” the lock before entering the critical section. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread must wait until the lock is “released.” Once done, the thread releases the lock, allowing another waiting thread to acquire it.\nAnalogy: A single key for a bathroom. Only the person with the key can enter. Others must wait for the key to be returned.\n\n\n\n\nDeadlocks:\n\nDefinition: A situation where two or more concurrent tasks are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource that is held by another task in the same group, resulting in a standstill.\nClassic Example (Conceptual - Dining Philosophers): Imagine five philosophers sitting around a circular table. There’s one chopstick between each pair of philosophers (5 chopsticks in total). Each philosopher needs two chopsticks (one from their left, one from their right) to eat.\nIf every philosopher simultaneously picks up the chopstick on their left, then each philosopher will be holding one chopstick and waiting for the chopstick on their right, which is held by their neighbor. No one can eat, and no one will release their chopstick – a deadlock.\nConditions often leading to deadlock (Coffman conditions - brief mention, not for memorization but for understanding the problem):\n\nMutual Exclusion: Resources cannot be shared.\nHold and Wait: A task holds at least one resource and is waiting for another.\nNo Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away.\nCircular Wait: A circular chain of tasks exists, where each task waits for a resource held by the next task in the chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus for CT: Appreciating that when tasks run “at the same time” and share things, new kinds of problems (like race conditions and deadlocks) can occur, and we need mechanisms (like locks) to coordinate them.\n\n\nProblem Solving Strategies\n\nRecap: What is an Algorithm?\n\nA clear, unambiguous, step-by-step sequence of instructions to solve a specific problem or achieve a defined outcome.\nIt should be correct, efficient (enough), and finite (terminate).\n\n\nGeneral Problem-Solving Heuristics (Polya’s Steps as a framework):\n\n\n\nUnderstand the Problem:\n\n\nRead or listen to the problem statement carefully. What is being asked?\nIdentify the inputs (givens), the outputs (what is required), and any constraints or conditions.\nCan you restate the problem in your own words? Can you draw a diagram or make a small example?\n\n\n\n\nDevise a Plan (Strategy):\n\n\nConsider similar problems you’ve solved before. Can you adapt those solutions?\nBreak the problem down into smaller, more manageable subproblems (Decomposition).\nSimplify the problem if it’s too complex. Solve the simpler version first.\nWork backwards from the desired output.\nLook for patterns (Pattern Recognition).\nUse logical reasoning. Consider edge cases and typical cases.\n\n\n\n\nCarry out the Plan (Implementation):\n\n\nTranslate your plan into a sequence of steps (e.g., pseudocode, flowchart, or actual code).\nCheck each step as you go.\n\n\n\n\nLook Back (Review and Reflect):\n\n\nTest your solution with various inputs (including edge cases) to verify its correctness.\nDoes it produce the correct output for all valid inputs? Does it handle invalid inputs gracefully?\nCan the solution be improved (e.g., made simpler, more efficient)?\nDid you learn anything new from solving this problem?\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition (Breaking Problems Down):\n\nThe strategy of dividing a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable, and often independent subproblems.\nEach subproblem can then be solved individually.\nThe solutions to the subproblems are then combined to form the solution to the original complex problem.\nExample: To write a book (complex problem), you might decompose it into: Outline chapters → Write content for Chapter 1 → Write content for Chapter 2 → … → Edit manuscript → Design cover.\nThis is a core part of top-down design and leads to modularity in algorithms (e.g., using procedures/functions for each subproblem).\n\n\nProblem-Solving Approaches:\n\nTop-Down Design (Stepwise Refinement):\n\nStart with a high-level, abstract statement of the problem or the main task.\nSystematically break it down into smaller, more detailed sub-tasks.\nContinue this process of refinement for each sub-task until the steps are simple and concrete enough to be directly translated into algorithmic instructions (or code).\nFocuses on the overall structure and flow first.\n\n\nBottom-Up Design:\n\nStart by identifying and implementing the most basic or fundamental operations and components that will be needed.\nOnce these low-level building blocks are created and tested, they are combined to form larger, more complex modules or procedures.\nThis process continues, building up layer by layer, until the complete solution is assembled.\nFocuses on building and testing individual components first.\n\n\nIn practice, problem-solving often involves a mix of both top-down and bottom-up thinking.\n\n\nAbstraction:\n\nThe process of focusing on the essential features of a problem or system while ignoring unnecessary or distracting details.\nProcedural Abstraction: When you use a procedure (or function), you focus on what it does (its purpose, inputs, and outputs) rather than how it does it (its internal implementation details). This allows you to use complex operations as simple building blocks.\nData Abstraction: Focusing on the properties and behaviors of a data type or data structure (like a List or Dictionary) rather than the specifics of how it’s stored in memory.\n\n\nPattern Recognition:\n\nThe ability to identify similarities, regularities, or recurring patterns within a problem itself, or between the current problem and problems solved previously.\nRecognizing a pattern can help you apply a known solution strategy or adapt an existing algorithm.\nExample: Realizing that multiple parts of a problem involve “finding an item in a collection” might suggest reusing a search procedure.\n\n\nDecision Trees (for Problem Solving and Classification - Simple Introduction):\n\nConcept: A tree-like graphical model where each internal node represents a “decision” or a “test” on an attribute (e.g., “Is it raining?”), each branch leading from a node represents an outcome or answer to that test (e.g., “Yes” or “No”), and each leaf node represents a final outcome, decision, or class label.\nUse in Problem Solving: Helps to structure a sequence of decisions to reach a conclusion. Useful for systematically exploring possibilities.\nExample: A simple diagnostic tree for a malfunctioning lamp.\n\nRoot: “Is the lamp plugged in?”\n\nNo → Leaf: “Plug in the lamp.”\nYes → Internal Node: “Is the bulb burned out?”\n\nYes → Leaf: “Replace the bulb.”\nNo → Leaf: “Lamp might be broken or other issue.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Classification: Decision trees can be used to assign an item to one of several predefined categories based on its features.\n\nExample: Classifying an email as “Spam” or “Not Spam” based on features like “contains word ‘free’?”, “sender known?“.\nBrief mention: In machine learning, decision trees can be automatically “learned” from data to make predictions. Here, the focus is on them as a way to structure human problem-solving logic.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping and Testing Algorithms:\n\nImportance of Testing: Crucial to ensure the algorithm is correct and reliable.\nTest Cases: Use a variety of inputs:\n\nNormal/Typical Cases: Expected inputs.\nEdge Cases: Inputs at the boundaries of valid ranges (e.g., smallest/largest allowed numbers, empty lists).\nInvalid Inputs: Data that the algorithm shouldn’t accept (to check error handling, though error handling itself might be an advanced topic).\n\n\nDebugging: The process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in an algorithm or its implementation.\n\nTechniques: Manual tracing (desk checking), simplifying the problem to isolate the error, adding display statements to see intermediate values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\nPseudocode: a simplified, language-agnostic way to describe algorithms.\nRecursion: a technique where a function calls itself to solve subproblems.\nEncapsulation: bundling data with methods that operate on that data.\nRace Condition: a flaw that occurs when operations depend on timing of events in concurrent systems.\n\nAdditional Topics\n\nHeuristics – strategies for approaching complex problems when an exact solution is impractical\nGreedy Algorithms – making the locally optimal choice at each step\nComplexity Analysis – big O notation to understand algorithm efficiency\n\nFurther Reading\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.\n"},"BSHS1001-English-I":{"slug":"BSHS1001-English-I","filePath":"BSHS1001 English I.md","title":"BSHS1001 English I","links":[],"tags":["course","language"],"content":"BSHS1001 English I\nCourse Credits: 4\nCourse Type: Foundational\nInstructors: Rajesh Kumar, Karthika Sathyanathan\nPre-requisites: None\nOverview\nDesigned to build fluency and confidence in spoken and written English, this course leverages insights from language learning theories and teaching methodologies.\nLearning Objectives\n\nExpand vocabulary and linguistic competence\nIdentify basic sentence structures with accuracy\nUnderstand language conventions used in society\nDevelop speaking and listening skills\nBuild foundations for creative reading and writing\n\nCourse Structure\n12 weeks of coursework with weekly online assignments, two invigilated quizzes and one invigilated end term exam.\nWeekly Topics\n\nSounds and Words – introduction to vowels, consonants and common minimal pairs\nParts of Speech – nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions and prepositions\nSentences – basic sentence patterns, common phrases and idiomatic usage\nSpeaking Skills – building confidence in conversation, greetings and polite expressions\nTenses &amp; Agreement – present, past and future tenses; subject‑verb agreement and continuous forms\nReading Skills – techniques for skimming, scanning and intensive reading\nListening Skills – strategies for active listening and note taking\nPronunciation – stress patterns, syllables, aspiration and intonation\nPresentation Skills – structuring short talks and engaging in group discussions\nGrammar &amp; Writing – avoiding common errors, forming coherent paragraphs and transitions\nWriting Basics – organising essays, coherence, cohesion and clarity\nProfessional Writing – composing emails, formal letters and concise reports\n\nGlossary\n\nSkimming: reading quickly to grasp the main idea.\nScanning: searching a text for specific information.\nSyllable: a unit of pronunciation containing a vowel sound.\n\nReference Texts\n\nOxford Modern English Grammar by Bas Aarts\nEnglish Grammar in Use (4th Edition) by Raymond Murphy\nShort fiction collections and other reading materials\n\nAdditional Topics\n\nVocabulary Building – roots, prefixes and suffixes to decode unfamiliar words\nPublic Speaking – organising thoughts, controlling pace and body language\nPeer Review – constructive feedback to refine writing style\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHow to Analyze People by Sebastian Croft\n"},"BSMA1001-Mathematics-for-Data-Science-I":{"slug":"BSMA1001-Mathematics-for-Data-Science-I","filePath":"BSMA1001 Mathematics for Data Science I.md","title":"BSMA1001 Mathematics for Data Science I","links":[],"tags":["course","math"],"content":"BSMA1001 Mathematics for Data Science I\nCourse Credits: 4\nCourse Type: Foundational\nInstructors: Neelesh Upadhye, Madhavan Mukund\nPre-requisites: None\nOverview\nThis course introduces straight lines, polynomials, exponentials, logarithms and the basics of discrete mathematics.

Some definitions include 0.\nWhole Numbers: Natural numbers including 0 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, …).\nIntegers (ℤ): Whole numbers and their negatives (e.g., …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …).\nRational Numbers (ℚ): Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0 (e.g., 1/2, -3/4, 5, 0.25). Rational numbers have terminating or repeating decimal expansions.\nIrrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction of two integers (e.g., √2, π, e). Their decimal expansions are non-terminating and non-repeating.\nReal Numbers (ℝ): All rational and irrational numbers. They can be represented on a number line.\n\n\nSets:\n\nDefinition: A well-defined collection of distinct objects, called elements or members.\nNotation:\n\nRoster Form: Listing all elements, e.g., A = {1, 2, 3}.\nSet-Builder Form: Describing elements by a property, e.g., B = {x | x is an even number and x &gt; 0}.\n\n\nTypes of Sets:\n\nEmpty Set (∅ or {}): A set with no elements.\nFinite Set: A set with a countable number of elements.\nInfinite Set: A set with an uncountable number of elements.\nSubset (⊆): Set A is a subset of set B if all elements of A are also elements of B. E.g., if A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}, then A ⊆ B.\nProper Subset (⊂): Set A is a proper subset of set B if A ⊆ B and A ≠ B.\nSuperset (⊇): If A is a subset of B, then B is a superset of A.\nPower Set (P(A)): The set of all subsets of set A, including the empty set and the set itself. If |A| = n, then |P(A)| = 2^n. Example: If A = {1, 2}, P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}.\nUniversal Set (U): The set containing all possible elements relevant to a particular discussion.\n\n\n\n\nSet Operations:\n\nUnion (A ∪ B): The set of elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. E.g., {1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}.\nIntersection (A ∩ B): The set of elements that are in both A and B. E.g., {1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} = {2}.\nDifference (A - B): The set of elements that are in A but not in B. E.g., {1, 2} - {2, 3} = {1}.\nComplement (A’): The set of elements in the universal set U that are not in A. A’ = U - A.\nCartesian Product (A × B): The set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. E.g., {1, 2} × {a} = {(1, a), (2, a)}.\nVenn Diagrams: Visual representations of sets and their relationships using overlapping circles.\nExample:\ngraph TD\n    A --- B\n\n(Illustrative: A real Venn diagram would show circles for A and B, with overlaps representing intersections.)\n\n\nRelations:\n\nDefinition: A set of ordered pairs (a, b) where ‘a’ is from a set A (domain) and ‘b’ is from a set B (codomain). The set of all second elements in the ordered pairs is called the range.\nDomain: The set of all first elements in the ordered pairs of a relation.\nCodomain: The set from which the second elements of the ordered pairs are chosen.\nRange: The set of all actual second elements in the ordered pairs. The range is a subset of the codomain.\nTypes of Relations (on a set A, i.e., from A to A):\n\nReflexive: A relation R on set A is reflexive if (a, a) ∈ R for every a ∈ A. Example: “is equal to” on ℤ. (5 = 5)\nSymmetric: A relation R on set A is symmetric if whenever (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) ∈ R. Example: “is a sibling of” (if A is a sibling of B, then B is a sibling of A).\nTransitive: A relation R on set A is transitive if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R. Example: “is less than” on ℕ (if a &lt; b and b &lt; c, then a &lt; c).\nEquivalence Relation: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. It partitions the set into disjoint equivalence classes. Example: “has the same remainder when divided by 3” on ℤ.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions:\n\nDefinition: A function f from a set A (domain) to a set B (codomain), denoted f: A → B, is a special type of relation where every element in A is associated with exactly one element in B.\nDomain: The set A.\nCodomain: The set B.\nRange: The set of all actual output values f(a) for a ∈ A. The range is a subset of the codomain.\nTypes of Functions:\n\nOne-to-one (Injective): A function where distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain. If f(x1) = f(x2), then x1 = x2.\nMany-to-one: A function where at least two distinct elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain.\nOnto (Surjective): A function where every element in the codomain B is an image of at least one element in the domain A. The range equals the codomain.\nOne-to-one Correspondence (Bijective): A function that is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).\n\n\nVertical Line Test: A graph represents a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point.\nComposition of Functions: Given f: A → B and g: B → C, the composition (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)).\nInverse Functions: If f: A → B is a bijective function, then its inverse function f⁻¹: B → A exists, such that if f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a.\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate Geometry\n\nRectangular Coordinate System (Cartesian Plane):\n\nA plane formed by two perpendicular number lines: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis.\nOrigin (0,0): The point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.\nQuadrants: The four regions into which the axes divide the plane (I, II, III, IV, numbered counter-clockwise starting from the top right).\nCoordinates of a Point (x, y): An ordered pair that specifies the location of a point, where x is the horizontal distance from the origin and y is the vertical distance.\n\n\nPlotting Points:\n\nTo plot a point (x, y), start at the origin, move x units horizontally (right if positive, left if negative), and then y units vertically (up if positive, down if negative).\nDistance Formula: The distance ‘d’ between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].\nMidpoint Formula: The midpoint M of a line segment connecting (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).\n\n\nSlope of a Line (m):\n\nDefinition: A measure of the steepness and direction of a line. It is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between any two distinct points on the line.\nFormula: Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).\nInterpretation of Slope:\n\nPositive Slope (m &gt; 0): Line rises from left to right.\nNegative Slope (m &lt; 0): Line falls from left to right.\nZero Slope (m = 0): Horizontal line.\nUndefined Slope: Vertical line (denominator x2 - x1 = 0).\n\n\n\n\nParallel and Perpendicular Lines:\n\nParallel Lines: Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal (m1 = m2).\nPerpendicular Lines: Two non-vertical lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is -1 (m1 * m2 = -1). This also means one slope is the negative reciprocal of the other (m2 = -1/m1).\n\n\nRepresentations of a Line:\n\nSlope-Intercept Form: y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept (the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis).\nPoint-Slope Form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\nTwo-Point Form: (y - y1) / (x - x1) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), derived from the slope formula using two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\nIntercept Form: x/a + y/b = 1, where ‘a’ is the x-intercept and ‘b’ is the y-intercept.\nGeneral Equation of a Line: Ax + By + C = 0, where A, B, and C are constants, and A and B are not both zero.\n\n\nStraight-line Fit (Introduction):\n\nIn data science, we often have a collection of data points that appear to follow a linear trend.\nStraight-line fitting, or linear regression, is the process of finding a single straight line that best represents the relationship in the data.\nVisually, this line tries to pass as close as possible to all data points. This line can then be used to make predictions or understand the underlying relationship between variables.\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic Functions\n\nQuadratic Functions:\n\nDefinition: A function of the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.\n\n\nParabolas:\n\nThe graph of a quadratic function is a U-shaped curve called a parabola.\nConcavity:\n\nIf a &gt; 0, the parabola opens upwards (concave up), and the vertex is the minimum point.\nIf a &lt; 0, the parabola opens downwards (concave down), and the vertex is the maximum point.\n\n\nAxis of Symmetry: A vertical line that divides the parabola into two mirror images. Its equation is x = -b / (2a).\n\n\nVertex:\n\nThe highest point (maximum) or lowest point (minimum) of the parabola.\nCoordinates of the Vertex (h, k): h = -b / (2a), and k = f(h) = f(-b / (2a)).\n\n\nVertex Form:\n\nThe vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.\nConversion from Standard Form (ax² + bx + c) to Vertex Form:\n\nIdentify a, b, c.\nCalculate h = -b / (2a).\nCalculate k = f(h) = a(h)² + b(h) + c.\nSubstitute a, h, k into f(x) = a(x - h)² + k.\n\n\n\n\nRoots/Zeros/X-intercepts:\n\nThese are the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis, i.e., where f(x) = 0.\nMethods to find roots:\n\nFactorisation: If the quadratic expression ax² + bx + c can be factored into a(x - r1)(x - r2), then r1 and r2 are the roots. Example: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, so roots are x = 2 and x = 3.\nQuadratic Formula: For ax² + bx + c = 0, the roots are given by x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\n\nDiscriminant (Δ): Δ = b² - 4ac. The discriminant determines the nature of the roots:\n\nIf Δ &gt; 0: Two distinct real roots (parabola intersects x-axis at two points).\nIf Δ = 0: One real root (or two equal real roots; parabola touches x-axis at one point - the vertex).\nIf Δ &lt; 0: No real roots (two complex conjugate roots; parabola does not intersect x-axis).\n\n\n\n\nCompleting the Square:\n\nA method used to solve quadratic equations and to convert the standard form of a quadratic function to the vertex form.\nSteps for ax² + bx + c = 0:\n\nIf a ≠ 1, divide the entire equation by a: x² + (b/a)x + (c/a) = 0.\nMove the constant term to the right side: x² + (b/a)x = -(c/a).\nTake half of the coefficient of x, square it, and add it to both sides. Half of (b/a) is (b/2a), squaring it gives (b/2a)².\nx² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)² = -(c/a) + (b/2a)².\nThe left side is now a perfect square: (x + b/2a)² = (b² - 4ac) / 4a².\nSolve for x by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n\n\n\nMaxima and Minima:\n\nThe vertex (h, k) of the parabola provides the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function.\nIf a &gt; 0 (parabola opens upwards), the function has a minimum value of k at x = h.\nIf a &lt; 0 (parabola opens downwards), the function has a maximum value of k at x = h.\nApplications: Used in optimization problems, e.g., finding the maximum height of a projectile or minimizing costs.\n\n\n\n\nPolynomials\n\nPolynomials:\n\nDefinition: An expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. Example: P(x) = 3x⁴ - 2x² + x - 5.\nDegree of a Polynomial: The highest power of the variable in the polynomial. In the example, the degree is 4.\nLeading Term: The term with the highest power of the variable (3x⁴).\nLeading Coefficient: The coefficient of the leading term (3).\nConstant Term: The term without a variable (-5).\nStandard Form: Polynomials are usually written in descending order of powers of the variable.\nTypes:\n\nMonomial: A polynomial with one term (e.g., 5x²).\nBinomial: A polynomial with two terms (e.g., 3x + 1).\nTrinomial: A polynomial with three terms (e.g., x² + 2x - 1).\n\n\n\n\nPolynomial Arithmetic:\n\nAddition and Subtraction: Combine like terms (terms with the same power of the variable).\nExample: (2x² + 3x - 1) + (x² - x + 4) = (2+1)x² + (3-1)x + (-1+4) = 3x² + 2x + 3.\nMultiplication: Use the distributive property. For binomials, the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method can be used.\nExample: (x + 2)(x - 3) = x(x) + x(-3) + 2(x) + 2(-3) = x² - 3x + 2x - 6 = x² - x - 6.\n\n\nDivision of Polynomials:\n\nLong Division: Similar to long division for numbers. Used to divide a polynomial by another polynomial of a lower or equal degree.\nExample: Divide x³ - 2x² + x - 5 by x - 2.\n      x²   + 1\n  ________________\nx-2 | x³ - 2x² +  x - 5\n    -(x³ - 2x²)\n    _________\n           0 +  x - 5\n             -(x - 2)\n             _______\n                   -3  (Remainder)\n\nSo, (x³ - 2x² + x - 5) / (x - 2) = x² + 1 with a remainder of -3.\nRemainder Theorem: If a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear binomial (x - c), the remainder is P(c).\nFor the example above, P(x) = x³ - 2x² + x - 5, c = 2. P(2) = 2³ - 2(2)² + 2 - 5 = 8 - 8 + 2 - 5 = -3, which is the remainder.\nFactor Theorem: A linear binomial (x - c) is a factor of the polynomial P(x) if and only if P(c) = 0 (i.e., the remainder is 0).\nSynthetic Division: A shortcut method for dividing a polynomial by a linear binomial of the form (x - c).\nExample: Divide x³ - 2x² + x - 5 by x - 2 (c=2).\n2 | 1  -2   1  -5\n  |    2   0   2\n  ----------------\n    1   0   1  -3\n\nThe coefficients of the quotient are 1, 0, 1 (so x² + 0x + 1 = x² + 1) and the remainder is -3.\n\n\nGraphs of Polynomials:\n\nX-intercepts (Roots/Zeros): The points where the graph intersects or touches the x-axis. These are the real solutions to P(x) = 0.\nMultiplicity of Roots: The number of times a particular root appears as a factor of the polynomial.\n\nOdd Multiplicity: The graph crosses the x-axis at the root. Example: P(x) = (x-1)¹.\nEven Multiplicity: The graph touches the x-axis at the root (bounces off). Example: P(x) = (x-1)².\n\n\nEnd Behavior: The direction of the graph as x approaches positive infinity (x → ∞) and as x approaches negative infinity (x → -∞). It is determined by the leading term (axⁿ):\n\nn is even, a &gt; 0: Up on left, Up on right (e.g., x²)\nn is even, a &lt; 0: Down on left, Down on right (e.g., -x²)\nn is odd, a &gt; 0: Down on left, Up on right (e.g., x³)\nn is odd, a &lt; 0: Up on left, Down on right (e.g., -x³)\n\n\nTurning Points: Points where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa. A polynomial of degree n has at most (n - 1) turning points.\n\n\nGraphing &amp; Polynomial Creation:\n\nTo sketch a polynomial graph: Find x-intercepts (roots) and their multiplicities, determine end behavior, find y-intercept (P(0)), and use turning points to guide the shape.\nCreating a polynomial equation: If the roots (r1, r2, …, rn) are known, the polynomial can be written in factored form: P(x) = a(x - r1)(x - r2)…(x - rn). The value of ‘a’ can be found if another point on the graph is known.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions (Advanced Topics)\n\nReview of Function Basics:\n\nDefinition: A rule that assigns each input element from a set (domain) to exactly one output element in another set (codomain).\nDomain: Set of all possible inputs.\nCodomain: Set of all possible outputs.\nRange: Set of all actual outputs.\n\n\nGraphical Tests for Functions:\n\nVertical Line Test: A curve in the xy-plane represents the graph of a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. This ensures that each x-value maps to only one y-value.\nHorizontal Line Test: A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once. This ensures that each y-value is mapped from only one x-value.\n\n\nOne-to-one and Many-to-one Functions (Deeper Dive):\n\nOne-to-one (Injective): Every distinct input produces a distinct output. Example: f(x) = 2x. If f(x1) = f(x2), then 2x1 = 2x2, which implies x1 = x2. These functions pass the Horizontal Line Test. They are crucial for having well-defined inverse functions.\nMany-to-one: At least two different inputs produce the same output. Example: f(x) = x². Here, f(2) = 4 and f(-2) = 4. These functions do not pass the Horizontal Line Test and do not have simple inverse functions unless their domain is restricted.\n\n\nInverse Functions:\n\nConditions for Existence: A function f must be bijective (both one-to-one and onto) to have an inverse function f⁻¹. If a function is not one-to-one, its inverse would not be a function (one input would map to multiple outputs). If it’s not onto, the domain of the inverse would not cover all of the original function’s codomain.\nFinding the Inverse:\n\nReplace f(x) with y.\nSwap x and y in the equation.\nSolve the new equation for y. The resulting expression is f⁻¹(x).\nExample: Find the inverse of f(x) = 2x + 3.\ny = 2x + 3\nx = 2y + 3 (swap)\nx - 3 = 2y\ny = (x - 3) / 2\nSo, f⁻¹(x) = (x - 3) / 2.\n\n\nGraphical Property: The graph of f⁻¹(x) is the reflection of the graph of f(x) across the line y = x.\nComposition Property: (f⁻¹ ∘ f)(x) = x and (f ∘ f⁻¹)(x) = x.\n\n\nExponential Functions:\n\nDefinition: A function of the form f(x) = aˣ, where ‘a’ is a positive constant called the base (a &gt; 0, a ≠ 1), and ‘x’ is the exponent.\nNatural Exponential Function: f(x) = eˣ, where ‘e’ is Euler’s number (approximately 2.71828). This base is frequently used in calculus and many natural phenomena.\nProperties:\n\nDomain: (-∞, ∞) (all real numbers).\nRange: (0, ∞) (all positive real numbers).\nY-intercept: (0, 1) because a⁰ = 1 for any a ≠ 0.\nHorizontal Asymptote: The x-axis (y=0) is a horizontal asymptote. The graph approaches but never touches the x-axis.\n\n\nGraphs:\n\nIf a &gt; 1, the function is increasing (exponential growth). Example: f(x) = 2ˣ.\nIf 0 &lt; a &lt; 1, the function is decreasing (exponential decay). Example: f(x) = (1/2)ˣ.\n\n\nApplications:\n\nCompound Interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).\nPopulation Growth: P(t) = P₀e^(kt).\nRadioactive Decay: N(t) = N₀e^(-λt).\n\n\n\n\nComposition of Functions (Further Examples):\n\nLet f(x) = x² + 1 and g(x) = √(x - 1).\n(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(√(x - 1)) = (√(x - 1))² + 1 = (x - 1) + 1 = x.\nDomain of g(x) is x ≥ 1. Range of g(x) is y ≥ 0. Domain of f(x) is all real numbers.\nDomain of (f ∘ g)(x) is x ≥ 1.\n(g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x² + 1) = √((x² + 1) - 1) = √(x²) = |x|.\nDomain of f(x) is all real numbers. Range of f(x) is y ≥ 1. Domain of g(x) requires input ≥ 1.\nSince x² + 1 is always ≥ 1, the domain of (g ∘ f)(x) is all real numbers.\n\n\n\n\nLogarithmic Functions\n\nDefinition of Logarithms:\n\nA logarithm is the power to which a base must be raised to produce a given number.\nIf y = aˣ (exponential form), then x = logₐ(y) (logarithmic form).\n‘a’ is the base (a &gt; 0, a ≠ 1), ‘y’ is the argument (y &gt; 0).\nExample: Since 2³ = 8, then log₂(8) = 3.\n\n\nCommon Logarithm: Base 10, written as log(x) or log₁₀(x). Used in various scientific scales.\nNatural Logarithm: Base ‘e’ (Euler’s number), written as ln(x) or logₑ(x). Arises naturally in calculus and models continuous growth/decay.\nRelationship between Logarithmic and Exponential Forms:\n\nlogₐ(y) = x  ⇐&gt;  aˣ = y\nExample: Convert log₃(9) = 2 to exponential form: 3² = 9.\nExample: Convert 5⁴ = 625 to logarithmic form: log₅(625) = 4.\n\n\nGraphs of Logarithmic Functions: f(x) = logₐ(x)\n\nDomain: (0, ∞) (only positive real numbers). You cannot take the logarithm of a negative number or zero.\nRange: (-∞, ∞) (all real numbers).\nX-intercept: (1, 0) because logₐ(1) = 0 (since a⁰ = 1).\nVertical Asymptote: The y-axis (x=0) is a vertical asymptote.\nShape:\n\nIf a &gt; 1, the graph is increasing. Example: f(x) = log₂(x).\nIf 0 &lt; a &lt; 1, the graph is decreasing. Example: f(x) = log₁/₂(x).\n\n\nThe graph of logₐ(x) is a reflection of the graph of aˣ across the line y = x.\n\n\nLaws of Logarithms:\n\nProduct Rule: logₐ(xy) = logₐ(x) + logₐ(y)  (The log of a product is the sum of the logs)\nQuotient Rule: logₐ(x/y) = logₐ(x) - logₐ(y) (The log of a quotient is the difference of the logs)\nPower Rule: logₐ(xᵖ) = p * logₐ(x) (The log of a number raised to a power is the power times the log of the number)\nChange of Base Formula: logₐ(x) = logb(x) / logb(a). This allows conversion between logarithms of different bases. Commonly used to convert to ln(x) or log(x) for calculator use: logₐ(x) = ln(x) / ln(a).\nOther properties: logₐ(a) = 1, logₐ(1) = 0, logₐ(aˣ) = x, a^(logₐ(x)) = x.\n\n\nSolving Exponential Equations:\n\nIf possible, make the bases the same: If aᵁ = aⱽ, then U = V.\nOtherwise, take the logarithm (common or natural) of both sides and use the power rule to bring down the exponent.\nExample: Solve 3ˣ = 10.\nln(3ˣ) = ln(10)\nx * ln(3) = ln(10)\nx = ln(10) / ln(3) ≈ 2.096.\n\n\nSolving Logarithmic Equations:\n\nUse laws of logarithms to combine terms into a single logarithm if possible.\nConvert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form.\nSolve for the variable.\nCrucial: Always check for extraneous solutions by substituting the solution back into the original equation. Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments.\nExample: Solve log₂(x) + log₂(x - 2) = 3.\nlog₂(x(x - 2)) = 3\nx(x - 2) = 2³\nx² - 2x = 8\nx² - 2x - 8 = 0\n(x - 4)(x + 2) = 0\nx = 4 or x = -2.\nCheck x = 4: log₂(4) + log₂(4 - 2) = 2 + log₂(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. (Valid)\nCheck x = -2: log₂(-2) is undefined. (Extraneous solution)\nSo, the only solution is x = 4.\n\n\nApplications:\n\npH Scale: pH = -log[H⁺] (concentration of hydrogen ions).\nRichter Scale: Magnitude M = log(I/S) (measures earthquake intensity).\nDecibel Levels (Sound Intensity): dB = 10 * log(P₁/P₀).\nInformation Theory: Entropy calculations.\n\n\n\n\nSequences and Limits\n\nSequences:\n\nDefinition: An ordered list of numbers, called terms. A sequence can be thought of as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers.\nNotation: Often denoted by {an} or an, where an is the nth term.\nExample: {1, 3, 5, 7, …}, where an = 2n - 1.\n\n\nArithmetic Sequences:\n\nDefinition: A sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference (d).\nFormula for nth term: an = a₁ + (n-1)d, where a₁ is the first term.\nSum of first n terms: Sn = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n-1)d] or Sn = n/2 * (a₁ + an).\nExample: Sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, … (a₁ = 2, d = 3). a₄ = 2 + (4-1)3 = 11.\n\n\nGeometric Sequences:\n\nDefinition: A sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. This constant ratio is called the common ratio (r).\nFormula for nth term: an = a₁ * r(n-1), where a₁ is the first term.\nSum of first n terms: Sn = a₁(1 - rn) / (1 - r), for r ≠ 1.\nSum of an infinite geometric series: If |r| &lt; 1, the series converges and its sum is S = a₁ / (1 - r). If |r| ≥ 1, the series diverges.\nExample: Sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, … (a₁ = 3, r = 2). a₄ = 3 * 2(4-1) = 24.\n\n\nIntroduction to Limits (Intuitive):\n\nThe concept of a limit describes the value that a function or sequence “approaches” as the input or index approaches some value.\nIt’s about the behavior of the function near a point, not necessarily at the point itself.\n\n\nLimits of Sequences:\n\nlim (n→∞) an = L means that the terms of the sequence an get arbitrarily close to L as n becomes very large.\nConvergent Sequence: A sequence that has a finite limit. Example: an = 1/n, lim (n→∞) 1/n = 0.\nDivergent Sequence: A sequence that does not have a finite limit (it may go to ∞, -∞, or oscillate). Example: an = n, lim (n→∞) n = ∞.\n\n\nLimits of Functions:\n\nlim (x→c) f(x) = L means that the values of f(x) get arbitrarily close to L as x gets arbitrarily close to c (but not equal to c).\nOne-Sided Limits:\n\nRight-hand limit: lim (x→c⁺) f(x) (x approaches c from values greater than c).\nLeft-hand limit: lim (x→c⁻) f(x) (x approaches c from values less than c).\nThe limit lim (x→c) f(x) exists if and only if lim (x→c⁺) f(x) = lim (x→c⁻) f(x) = L.\n\n\n\n\nLimit Laws/Properties: If lim (x→c) f(x) = L and lim (x→c) g(x) = M:\n\nSum Rule: lim [f(x) + g(x)] = L + M.\nDifference Rule: lim [f(x) - g(x)] = L - M.\nProduct Rule: lim [f(x) * g(x)] = L * M.\nQuotient Rule: lim [f(x) / g(x)] = L / M (if M ≠ 0).\nConstant Multiple Rule: lim [k * f(x)] = k * L.\nPower Rule: lim [f(x)]n = Ln.\n\n\nEvaluating Limits:\n\nDirect Substitution: If f(x) is a polynomial or rational function and c is in its domain, then lim (x→c) f(x) = f(c).\nFactorization and Cancellation: For indeterminate forms like 0/0. Example: lim (x→1) (x²-1)/(x-1) = lim (x→1) (x-1)(x+1)/(x-1) = lim (x→1) (x+1) = 2.\nRationalization: Multiplying by the conjugate, often for limits involving square roots.\nL’Hôpital’s Rule (brief mention): If a limit is of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞, it can sometimes be evaluated by taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator. (More detail in Week 8).\n\n\nTangent Lines (Conceptual Link to Limits):\n\nA secant line passes through two points on a curve. Its slope is (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c).\nA tangent line touches the curve at a single point c. Its slope is found by taking the limit of the slopes of secant lines as x approaches c: m_tangent = lim (x→c) [f(x) - f(c)] / (x - c). This is the definition of the derivative.\n\n\nContinuity:\n\nDefinition of Continuity at a Point: A function f is continuous at a point x=c if all three conditions are met:\n\nf(c) is defined (c is in the domain of f).\nlim (x→c) f(x) exists (left-hand limit = right-hand limit).\nlim (x→c) f(x) = f(c) (the limit equals the function value).\n\n\nContinuity on an Interval: A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. Most common functions (polynomials, rational functions where defined, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric) are continuous on their domains.\n\n\nDiscontinuities: Points where a function is not continuous.\n\nTypes:\n\nRemovable Discontinuity (Hole): Occurs when lim (x→c) f(x) exists but is not equal to f(c), or f(c) is undefined. Graphically, there’s a hole in the graph. Example: f(x) = (x²-1)/(x-1) at x=1.\nJump Discontinuity: Occurs when the left-hand limit and right-hand limit both exist but are not equal. Graphically, there’s a jump in the graph. Example: A step function like f(x) = 1 for x ≥ 0, and f(x) = -1 for x &lt; 0, at x=0.\nInfinite Discontinuity (Asymptotic): Occurs when one or both of the one-sided limits go to ∞ or -∞. Graphically, there’s a vertical asymptote. Example: f(x) = 1/x at x=0.\n\n\nIntermediate Value Theorem: If f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], and N is any number between f(a) and f(b) (where f(a) ≠ f(b)), then there exists at least one number c in (a, b) such that f(c) = N. Intuitively, a continuous function doesn’t skip values.\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives &amp; Critical Points\n\nDefinition of the Derivative:\n\nAs the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at point x:\nf’(x) = lim (h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h\nThis limit represents the slope of the line that just touches the curve at x.\nAs the instantaneous rate of change of the function f(x) with respect to x.\nExample: If f(t) is position at time t, f’(t) is instantaneous velocity.\nNotations:\n\nLagrange’s notation: f’(x) (read “f prime of x”)\nLeibniz’s notation: dy/dx (read “d y d x” or “derivative of y with respect to x”)\ny’ (read “y prime”)\nd/dx [f(x)] (operator notation)\n\n\n\n\nDifferentiability:\n\nA function is differentiable at a point x=c if f’(c) exists.\nConditions for Non-differentiability:\n\nCorners: e.g., f(x) = |x| at x=0. The left and right limits of the difference quotient are different.\nCusps: e.g., f(x) = x^(2/3) at x=0. Slopes of secant lines approach ∞ from one side and -∞ from the other.\nVertical Tangents: e.g., f(x) = x^(1/3) at x=0. The tangent line is vertical, so its slope is undefined.\nDiscontinuities: If a function is not continuous at a point, it cannot be differentiable at that point.\n\n\nRelationship between Differentiability and Continuity: If a function is differentiable at a point, it MUST be continuous at that point. However, a function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there (e.g., f(x) = |x| at x=0).\n\n\nBasic Differentiation Rules:\n\nConstant Rule: d/dx (c) = 0 (The derivative of a constant is zero).\nPower Rule: d/dx (xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹ (For any real number n). Example: d/dx (x³) = 3x².\nConstant Multiple Rule: d/dx [c * f(x)] = c * f’(x). Example: d/dx (5x³) = 5 * (3x²) = 15x².\nSum/Difference Rule: d/dx [f(x) ± g(x)] = f’(x) ± g’(x). Example: d/dx (x² + 3x) = 2x + 3.\nDerivative of eˣ: d/dx (eˣ) = eˣ.\nDerivative of ln(x): d/dx (ln(x)) = 1/x (for x &gt; 0).\n\n\nProduct Rule: For differentiating the product of two functions:\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = f’(x)g(x) + f(x)g’(x)\nExample: d/dx (x² * eˣ) = (2x)(eˣ) + (x²)(eˣ) = xeˣ(2 + x).\n\n\nQuotient Rule: For differentiating the quotient of two functions:\n\nd/dx [f(x)/g(x)] = [f’(x)g(x) - f(x)g’(x)] / [g(x)]² (where g(x) ≠ 0)\nExample: d/dx (x² / (x+1)) = [2x(x+1) - x²(1)] / (x+1)² = (2x² + 2x - x²) / (x+1)² = (x² + 2x) / (x+1)².\n\n\nChain Rule (Introduction): For differentiating composite functions f(g(x)):\n\nd/dx [f(g(x))] = f’(g(x)) * g’(x) (Derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function).\nExample: d/dx [(x² + 1)³]. Let u = x² + 1 (inner), f(u) = u³ (outer).\nf’(u) = 3u², u’(x) = 2x.\nSo, d/dx [(x² + 1)³] = 3(x² + 1)² * (2x) = 6x(x² + 1)².\n\n\nL’Hôpital’s Rule:\n\nUsed to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms like 0/0 or ∞/∞.\nIf lim (x→c) f(x)/g(x) is of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞, AND if lim (x→c) f’(x)/g’(x) exists (or is ±∞),\nthen lim (x→c) f(x)/g(x) = lim (x→c) f’(x)/g’(x).\nExample: lim (x→0) sin(x)/x (form 0/0).\nlim (x→0) cos(x)/1 = cos(0)/1 = 1/1 = 1.\n\n\nCritical Points:\n\nA point ‘c’ in the domain of f is a critical point if either f’(c) = 0 or f’(c) is undefined.\nThese are candidates for where local maxima or minima can occur.\n\n\nFinding Extrema (Local/Relative Maxima and Minima):\n\nLocal Maximum: A point where the function’s value is greater than or equal to the values at nearby points.\nLocal Minimum: A point where the function’s value is less than or equal to the values at nearby points.\nFirst Derivative Test:\n\nFind critical points of f.\nDetermine the sign of f’(x) in intervals to the left and right of each critical point.\n\n\nIf f’(x) changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a local maximum at c.\nIf f’(x) changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a local minimum at c.\nIf f’(x) does not change sign at c, then f has neither a local maximum nor minimum at c (e.g., a saddle point or horizontal inflection).\n\n\nIntervals of Increase and Decrease:\n\nIf f’(x) &gt; 0 on an interval, f is increasing on that interval.\nIf f’(x) &lt; 0 on an interval, f is decreasing on that interval.\n\n\n\n\nLinear Approximation:\n\nThe tangent line to the graph of f(x) at x=a can be used to approximate values of f(x) for x near a.\nThe equation of the tangent line is L(x) = f(a) + f’(a)(x-a).\nSo, for x near a, f(x) ≈ f(a) + f’(a)(x-a).\nExample: Approximate √4.1. Let f(x) = √x, a = 4.\nf(a) = √4 = 2.\nf’(x) = 1/(2√x), so f’(a) = f’(4) = 1/(2√4) = 1/4.\n√4.1 ≈ f(4) + f’(4)(4.1 - 4) = 2 + (1/4)(0.1) = 2 + 0.025 = 2.025.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrals\n\nAntiderivatives:\n\nConcept: If the derivative of F(x) is f(x) (i.e., F’(x) = f(x)), then F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x).\nReversing Differentiation: Integration is often thought of as the reverse process of differentiation.\nFamily of Antiderivatives: If F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then any function of the form F(x) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant (the constant of integration), is also an antiderivative. This is because the derivative of a constant is zero.\nExample: If f(x) = 2x, then F(x) = x² is an antiderivative, because d/dx(x²) = 2x. So are x² + 5, x² - 3, etc. We write the general antiderivative as x² + C.\n\n\nIndefinite Integrals:\n\nNotation: ∫f(x)dx represents the family of all antiderivatives of f(x). It is called the indefinite integral of f(x) with respect to x.\n∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C, where F’(x) = f(x).\nBasic Integration Rules (reverse of differentiation rules):\n\nPower Rule: ∫xⁿdx = (xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1). Example: ∫x³dx = x⁴/4 + C.\nConstant Rule: ∫kdx = kx + C.\nConstant Multiple Rule: ∫k*f(x)dx = k * ∫f(x)dx.\nSum/Difference Rule: ∫[f(x) ± g(x)]dx = ∫f(x)dx ± ∫g(x)dx.\nIntegral of eˣ: ∫eˣdx = eˣ + C.\nIntegral of 1/x: ∫(1/x)dx = ln|x| + C (absolute value is important as x can be negative, but ln is defined for positive values).\n\n\n\n\nArea Under a Curve:\n\nThe problem: Finding the exact area of a region in the xy-plane bounded by the graph of a non-negative continuous function y = f(x), the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = a and x = b.\n\n\nRiemann Sums:\n\nApproximating Area: The area under the curve is approximated by dividing the interval [a, b] into n subintervals of equal width Δx = (b-a)/n, and then summing the areas of rectangles constructed on these subintervals.\nTypes of Sums:\n\nLeft Riemann Sum: Uses the left endpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of the rectangle: Σ f(xi-1)Δx.\nRight Riemann Sum: Uses the right endpoint: Σ f(xi)Δx.\nMidpoint Riemann Sum: Uses the midpoint: Σ f((xi-1+xi)/2)Δx.\n\n\nDefinition of the Definite Integral: The definite integral of f(x) from a to b is the limit of these Riemann sums as the number of subintervals n approaches infinity (and Δx approaches 0):\n∫ab f(x)dx = lim (n→∞) Σi=1n f(xi)Δx, where xi is any sample point in the i-th subinterval.\nIf the limit exists, f(x) is said to be integrable on [a, b].\n\n\nDefinite Integrals:\n\nNotation: ∫ab f(x)dx, where ‘a’ is the lower limit of integration and ‘b’ is the upper limit.\nInterpretation: Represents the net signed area between the curve f(x) and the x-axis from x=a to x=b. Areas above the x-axis are positive; areas below are negative.\nProperties:\n\n∫aa f(x)dx = 0.\n∫ab f(x)dx = -∫ba f(x)dx.\n∫ab k*f(x)dx = k * ∫ab f(x)dx.\n∫ab [f(x) ± g(x)]dx = ∫ab f(x)dx ± ∫ab g(x)dx.\n∫ac f(x)dx + ∫cb f(x)dx = ∫ab f(x)dx.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC):\n\nPart 1 (FTC1): If f is continuous on [a, b] and F(x) is defined as F(x) = ∫ax f(t)dt, then F’(x) = f(x) for every x in [a, b].\nThis part shows that differentiation and integration are inverse processes: the derivative of an integral (defined as an area function) is the original function.\nPart 2 (FTC2 - Evaluation Theorem): If f is continuous on [a, b] and F is any antiderivative of f (i.e., F’(x) = f(x)), then:\n∫ab f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a).\nThis provides a powerful method for evaluating definite integrals without directly using the limit of Riemann sums.\nExample: Evaluate ∫13 x²dx.\nAn antiderivative of x² is F(x) = x³/3.\nSo, ∫13 x²dx = F(3) - F(1) = (3³/3) - (1³/3) = 27/3 - 1/3 = 9 - 1/3 = 26/3.\n\n\nApplications of Integration:\n\nArea Calculation: Primary application discussed. Area between two curves: ∫ab [f(x) - g(x)]dx.\nNet Change: If f’(x) is the rate of change of a quantity f(x), then ∫ab f’(x)dx = f(b) - f(a) gives the net change in f(x) from x=a to x=b.\nAverage Value of a Function: The average value of f(x) on [a,b] is (1/(b-a)) * ∫ab f(x)dx.\n\n\nBasic Techniques of Integration:\n\nSubstitution Rule (u-substitution): Used to integrate composite functions. It’s the reverse of the chain rule for differentiation.\nIf u = g(x), then du = g’(x)dx. So, ∫f(g(x))g’(x)dx = ∫f(u)du.\nExample: ∫2x * (x² + 1)⁵ dx.\nLet u = x² + 1. Then du = 2x dx.\nThe integral becomes ∫u⁵du = u⁶/6 + C = (x² + 1)⁶/6 + C.\n\n\n\n\nGraph Theory Basics\n\nIntroduction to Graphs:\n\nDefinition: A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) and a set E of edges (or links/arcs), where each edge connects two vertices.\nExamples: Social networks (people are vertices, friendships are edges), road networks (intersections are vertices, roads are edges), the World Wide Web (web pages are vertices, hyperlinks are edges).\n\n\nTypes of Graphs:\n\nUndirected Graph: Edges have no orientation; (u, v) is the same as (v, u).\nDirected Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction; (u, v) goes from u to v.\nWeighted Graph: Each edge has an associated numerical value (weight or cost). Unweighted graphs assume all edges have weight 1 or are simply unconcerned with weight.\nSimple Graph: An unweighted, undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\nMultigraph: Allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\nPseudograph: Allows loops and multiple edges.\nComplete Graph (Kn): A simple undirected graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. Kn has n(n-1)/2 edges.\nCycle (Cn): A graph with n vertices where vertices are connected in a circular fashion (v1-v2-…-vn-v1).\nPath (Pn): A graph with n vertices connected in a line.\nBipartite Graph: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.\n\n\nGraph Terminology:\n\nAdjacent Vertices (Neighbors): Two vertices are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.\nDegree of a Vertex (for undirected graphs): The number of edges incident to it. Sum of degrees = 2|E|.\nIn-degree (for digraphs): Number of edges pointing to a vertex.\nOut-degree (for digraphs): Number of edges pointing from a vertex. Sum of in-degrees = Sum of out-degrees = |E|.\nPath: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.\nCycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex and does not repeat other vertices.\nConnected Graph (undirected): There is a path between every pair of distinct vertices.\nConnected Components: The maximally connected subgraphs of an undirected graph.\nStrongly Connected Components (digraphs): A digraph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from u to v and from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v. SCCs are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs.\n\n\nRepresenting Graphs:\n\nAdjacency Matrix: A |V| x |V| matrix A where A[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, and 0 otherwise. For weighted graphs, A[i][j] can store the weight.\n\nPros: Fast to check if an edge (i,j) exists (O(1)).\nCons: Space complexity O(|V|²), which is inefficient for sparse graphs (graphs with few edges). Adding/removing vertices is hard.\n\n\nAdjacency List: An array of lists. For each vertex u, Adj[u] stores a list of vertices adjacent to u. For weighted graphs, the list can store pairs (neighbor, weight).\n\nPros: Space efficient for sparse graphs O(|V| + |E|). Easy to iterate over neighbors of a vertex.\nCons: Checking for an edge (u,v) can take O(degree(u)) time.\n\n\n\n\nGraph Traversals: Algorithms for systematically visiting all vertices in a graph.\n\nBreadth-First Search (BFS):\n\nAlgorithm: Starts at a source vertex, explores all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level. Uses a queue.\nProperties: Finds the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from the source to all other vertices in an unweighted graph.\nExample: Useful for finding connected components, shortest paths in unweighted graphs.\n\n\nDepth-First Search (DFS):\n\nAlgorithm: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses a stack (often implicitly via recursion).\nProperties: Useful for cycle detection, topological sorting, finding connected components, path finding.\nExample: Can produce a DFS tree/forest.\n\n\n\n\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):\n\nDefinition: A directed graph that contains no directed cycles.\nExamples: Task scheduling (tasks and their dependencies), prerequisite charts for courses, version history in Git.\n\n\nTopological Sorting:\n\nDefinition: A linear ordering of vertices in a DAG such that for every directed edge (u,v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. A DAG can have multiple topological sorts.\nAlgorithms:\n\nKahn’s Algorithm: Based on in-degrees. Repeatedly find vertices with in-degree 0, add them to the sort, and remove their outgoing edges. Uses a queue.\nDFS-based Algorithm: Perform DFS. The topological sort is the reverse of the finishing times of the vertices.\n\n\nExample: If A depends on B, and B depends on C, a topological sort could be C, B, A.\n\n\nApplications: Network analysis (social, biological, computer networks), recommendation systems (user-item interactions), logistics and operations research, bioinformatics (gene interactions), circuit design.\n\n\nGraph Algorithms\n\nShortest Path Problems: Finding a path between two vertices such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.\n\nSingle-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP): Find the shortest paths from a single source vertex ‘s’ to all other vertices in the graph.\n\nDijkstra’s Algorithm:\n\nApplies to graphs with non-negative edge weights.\nAlgorithm: Maintains a set of visited vertices and distances to all vertices (initially 0 for source, ∞ for others). Iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance, marks it visited, and updates distances to its neighbors. Often implemented using a priority queue.\nExample: GPS navigation, network routing protocols.\nLimitations: Fails if there are negative edge weights because its greedy choice might not be optimal in such cases.\n\n\nBellman-Ford Algorithm:\n\nApplies to graphs that may include negative edge weights.\nAlgorithm: Relaxes all edges |V|-1 times. In each relaxation step, it updates distances if a shorter path is found. After |V|-1 iterations, if distances can still be improved, a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source is detected.\nExample: Detecting arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange.\nHandles negative weights correctly and can detect negative cycles (if after |V|-1 iterations, an edge can still be relaxed, a negative cycle exists).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP): Finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph.\n\nFloyd-Warshall Algorithm:\n\nDynamic programming approach.\nAlgorithm: Iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices for each pair of start and end vertices. For each pair (i,j) and intermediate vertex k, it checks if path i-k-j is shorter than the current path i-j.\nComplexity: O(|V|³).\nExample: Precomputing distances in a network, transit route planning.\nHandles negative edge weights (but reports existence if negative cycles make shortest paths undefined).\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Spanning Trees (MST):\n\nDefinition: Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, an MST is a subgraph that connects all vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\nApplications: Network design (e.g., laying cables to connect cities with minimum cost), clustering, image segmentation.\nPrim’s Algorithm:\n\nGreedy algorithm that builds the MST one vertex at a time.\nAlgorithm: Starts with an arbitrary vertex. In each step, adds the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing MST to a vertex outside the MST. Often uses a priority queue to select the minimum weight edge.\nExample: Good for dense graphs.\n\n\nKruskal’s Algorithm:\n\nGreedy algorithm that builds the MST one edge at a time.\nAlgorithm: Sorts all edges by weight in ascending order. Iteratively adds the next cheapest edge if it does not form a cycle with previously added edges. Uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently detect cycles.\nExample: Good for sparse graphs.\n\n\n\n\nApplications: Network routing (OSPF, RIP use SSSP), flight or traffic information systems, gene network analysis, image processing, efficient resource allocation.\n\n\nRevision\n\nSummary of Key Concepts:\n\nSet Theory &amp; Basic Logic: Number systems, set operations, relations, functions.\nFunctions: Properties of linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions; their graphs and applications.

This includes measures like mean, median, mode, and graphical displays like histograms, bar charts, etc. Example: Calculating the average marks of students in a class.\nInferential Statistics: Involves methods used to draw conclusions or make inferences about a larger group (population) based on information obtained from a smaller group (sample). Example: Predicting election results based on a sample survey.\n\n\nPopulation vs. Sample:\n\nPopulation (N): The complete set of all individuals, items, or data of interest. For example, all students in a university.\nSample (n): A subset of the population selected for study. For example, 100 students selected from that university.\nParameter: A numerical value summarizing a characteristic of a population. Usually denoted by Greek letters (e.g., population mean μ, population standard deviation σ).\nStatistic: A numerical value summarizing a characteristic of a sample. Usually denoted by Roman letters (e.g., sample mean x̄, sample standard deviation s).\nReason for Sampling: Studying the entire population may be too costly, time-consuming, or impractical. Samples allow us to get manageable data.\nRandom Sampling: Techniques where each member of the population has a known chance of being selected, aiming to get a representative sample (e.g., Simple Random Sampling).\n\n\nVariables:\n\nA characteristic or attribute that can assume different values for different individuals or items. Examples: age, gender, income, test score.\n\n\nTypes of Data (Scales of Measurement):\n\nQualitative (Categorical) Data: Represents categories or labels.\n\nNominal Scale: Data consist of names, labels, or categories that cannot be ordered. Arithmetic operations are meaningless. Examples: Gender (Male, Female), Eye Color (Blue, Brown, Green), Country of Origin.\nOrdinal Scale: Data can be arranged in some order, but differences between data values either cannot be determined or are meaningless. Examples: Education Level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), Survey Ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), Social Class (Lower, Middle, Upper).\n\n\nQuantitative (Numerical) Data: Represents numerical values.\n\nDiscrete Data: Values are countable and often integers. There are gaps between possible values. Examples: Number of children in a family (0, 1, 2…), Number of cars sold, Number of defects in a product.\nContinuous Data: Values can take on any numerical value within a given range (measurable). Examples: Height (165.2 cm, 170.5 cm), Weight, Temperature, Time.\nInterval Scale: Data can be ordered, and differences between data values are meaningful. However, there is no true zero point (a point that indicates absence of the quantity). Ratios are not meaningful. Examples: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C doesn’t mean no temperature; 20°C is not twice as hot as 10°C), Calendar Years (Year 0 is arbitrary).\nRatio Scale: Data can be ordered, differences are meaningful, and there is a true zero point. Ratios between values are meaningful. Examples: Height (0 cm means no height, 200 cm is twice as tall as 100 cm), Weight, Age, Income, Number of items.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Summarize Data (Overview):\n\nFrequency Distributions: Organizing data into tables showing how often each value or category occurs.\nGraphical Displays: Visualizing data using charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, histograms).\nNumerical Summaries: Calculating statistics that describe central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and dispersion (e.g., variance, standard deviation).\n\n\nData Collection Methods (Brief Overview):\n\nSurveys: Collecting data by asking questions (e.g., questionnaires, interviews).\nExperiments: Manipulating one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable (e.g., clinical trials).\nObservational Studies: Observing and measuring characteristics without attempting to modify the subjects being studied (e.g., watching animal behavior in the wild).\nPrimary Data: Data collected directly by the researcher for a specific purpose.\nSecondary Data: Data collected by someone else that the researcher uses (e.g., government statistics, existing databases).\n\n\n\n\nDescribing Categorical Data\n\nFrequency Distribution for Categorical Data:\n\nFrequency (f): The count of observations falling into each category.\nRelative Frequency (rf): The proportion of observations falling into each category. Calculated as: Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total number of observations (n). It can be expressed as a decimal or a percentage.\nFrequency Table / Contingency Table (for one variable): A table that lists each category and its corresponding frequency and/or relative frequency.\nExample: Survey of 50 people’s favorite fruit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFruitFrequency (f)Relative Frequency (rf)Apple1515/50 = 0.30 (30%)Banana2020/50 = 0.40 (40%)Orange1010/50 = 0.20 (20%)Other55/50  = 0.10 (10%)Total501.00 (100%)\n\n\n\nGraphical Displays for Categorical Data:\n\nBar Charts (Bar Graphs):\n\nConstruction: Categories are displayed on one axis (usually horizontal) and frequencies or relative frequencies are displayed on the other axis (usually vertical). Bars are drawn for each category with height proportional to its frequency. Bars should be of equal width and have gaps between them to emphasize the distinctness of categories.\nInterpretation: Allows for easy comparison of the frequency of different categories.\n\n\nPie Charts:\n\nConstruction: A circle divided into sectors, where each sector represents a category and its area (or angle) is proportional to the category’s relative frequency. Angle = Relative Frequency * 360°.\nInterpretation: Best for showing how each category contributes to the whole (i.e., parts of 100%).\nLimitations: Can be difficult to compare sizes of sectors, especially if there are many categories or if frequencies are similar. Generally not recommended for more than 5-7 categories.\n\n\nPareto Charts (Optional but good):\n\nA type of bar chart where the bars are arranged in descending order of frequency from left to right. A cumulative frequency line is often overlaid.\nPurpose: Helps to identify the “vital few” categories that contain the bulk of the observations (Pareto Principle - 80/20 rule).\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency for Categorical Data:\n\nMode: The category that occurs with the highest frequency.\n\nA dataset can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), or multimodal (more than two modes). If all categories have the same frequency, there is no mode.\nExample: In the fruit survey above, the mode is “Banana”.\n\n\nMedian (for Ordinal Data): The middle category when the data are ordered.\n\nTo find the median for ordinal data:\n\nArrange the observed categories in ascending or descending order.\nIf the total number of observations (n) is odd, the median is the category of the ((n+1)/2)-th observation.\nIf n is even, the median falls between two categories; often, it’s reported by identifying both or through specific conventions if applicable. For purely ordinal data, a single “middle” category might not be precise if it falls between two different categories after ordering.\n\n\nExample: Ratings: Poor, Poor, Good, Good, Good, Excellent, Excellent. Ordered: Poor, Poor, Good, Good, Good, Excellent, Excellent (n=7). Median is the (7+1)/2 = 4th observation, which is “Good”.\nMean is not suitable for nominal data as categories don’t have numerical values. For ordinal data, assigning numerical scores to categories to calculate a mean can be done but is often debated and depends on the assumption of equal spacing between categories.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Graphing Categorical Data:\n\nAlways provide a clear title for the chart.\nLabel axes and categories clearly.\nEnsure the scale for frequencies (on bar charts) starts at zero to avoid misrepresentation.\nAvoid using 3D effects on bar charts or pie charts as they can distort perception of sizes/proportions.\nChoose the chart type that best conveys the information (e.g., pie chart for parts of a whole, bar chart for comparing frequencies).\n\n\n\n\nDescribing Numerical Data\n\nFrequency Distribution for Numerical Data:\n\nClasses/Bins: For continuous or discrete data with many values, data is grouped into intervals called classes or bins.\n\nChoosing Class Width: Should be manageable and appropriate for the data. Too wide may hide details; too narrow may result in too few observations per class. (Number of classes often between 5 and 20).\nClass Boundaries: Must be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity (e.g., 10-19, 20-29 or [10, 20), [20, 30)).\n\n\nFrequency Table: Lists the classes and their corresponding frequencies (number of data points falling into each class).\nRelative Frequency: Frequency of a class / Total number of observations.\nCumulative Frequency: The sum of frequencies for that class and all preceding classes.\nCumulative Relative Frequency: The sum of relative frequencies for that class and all preceding classes.\n\n\nGraphical Displays for Numerical Data:\n\nHistograms:\n\nConstruction: Similar to bar charts, but for numerical data. The horizontal axis represents the classes/bins of the numerical variable, and the vertical axis represents the frequency or relative frequency. Bars are drawn adjacent to each other (no gaps) to indicate the continuous nature of the data (or that bins are consecutive).\nInterpretation: Shows the shape of the data’s distribution (e.g., symmetric/bell-shaped, skewed left, skewed right, unimodal, bimodal). Also gives an idea of central tendency and spread.\n\n\nFrequency Polygons:\n\nConstruction: Line graph formed by connecting the midpoints of the tops of the histogram bars. The polygon is usually anchored to the x-axis at the midpoints of the classes before the first class and after the last class.\nInterpretation: Similar to histogram, useful for comparing distributions of two or more datasets on the same graph.\n\n\nOgives (Cumulative Frequency Graphs):\n\nConstruction: A line graph that plots the cumulative frequency or cumulative relative frequency (on the y-axis) against the upper class boundaries (on the x-axis).\nInterpretation: Useful for estimating the number or percentage of observations below a certain value, and for finding percentiles (e.g., median).\n\n\nStem-and-Leaf Plots:\n\nConstruction: Each data value is split into a “stem” (usually the leading digit(s)) and a “leaf” (usually the last digit). Stems are listed vertically, and leaves are listed horizontally next to their corresponding stems.\nInterpretation: Retains actual data values while showing the shape of the distribution. Useful for smaller datasets.\n\n\nDot Plots:\n\nConstruction: Each data value is represented as a dot plotted above its corresponding value on a number line. Dots are stacked if values repeat.\nInterpretation: Useful for small datasets to see individual values and distribution shape.\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency for Numerical Data:\n\nMean (Arithmetic Average):\n\nSample Mean (x̄) = (Σxi) / n\nPopulation Mean (μ) = (ΣXi) / N\nInterpretation: The “balance point” of the data. Sensitive to extreme values (outliers).\n\n\nMedian: The middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order.\n\nIf n is odd, median is the ((n+1)/2)-th value.\nIf n is even, median is the average of the (n/2)-th and ((n/2)+1)-th values.\nInterpretation: Divides the data into two equal halves. Robust to outliers.\n\n\nMode: The value(s) that occur most frequently.\n\nCan be unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or no mode if all values are unique.\n\n\nRelationship between Mean, Median, and Mode:\n\nSymmetric Distribution: Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode.\nRight-Skewed (Positively Skewed) Distribution: Mean &gt; Median &gt; Mode. (Tail to the right)\nLeft-Skewed (Negatively Skewed) Distribution: Mean &lt; Median &lt; Mode. (Tail to the left)\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Position/Location:\n\nQuartiles: Values that divide the sorted data into four equal parts.\n\nQ1 (First Quartile): 25th percentile. 25% of data lies below Q1.\nQ2 (Second Quartile): 50th percentile. This is the Median.\nQ3 (Third Quartile): 75th percentile. 75% of data lies below Q3.\nCalculation: Various methods exist, often involving finding medians of lower/upper halves of data.\n\n\nPercentiles: Pk is the value below which k percent of the observations lie. Q1 = P25, Median = P50, Q3 = P75.\n\n\nMeasures of Dispersion/Spread/Variability: Describe how spread out the data values are.\n\nRange: Maximum value - Minimum value. Simple to calculate but very sensitive to outliers.\nInterquartile Range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1. The range of the middle 50% of the data. Robust to outliers.\nVariance: The average of the squared deviations of each data value from the mean.\n\nSample Variance (s²): Σ(xi - x̄)² / (n-1). Division by (n-1) provides an unbiased estimator of population variance. (n-1) is degrees offreedom.\nPopulation Variance (σ²): Σ(Xi - μ)² / N.\nUnits are squared (e.g., if data is in cm, variance is in cm²).\n\n\nStandard Deviation: The square root of the variance.\n\nSample Standard Deviation (s) = √s²\nPopulation Standard Deviation (σ) = √σ²\nInterpretation: A typical or average distance of data values from the mean. Measured in the same units as the original data.\nChebyshev’s Rule: For any dataset, at least (1 - 1/k²) of the data lies within k standard deviations of the mean (for k &gt; 1).\nEmpirical Rule (for bell-shaped/normal distributions): Approx. 68% of data within ±1σ, 95% within ±2σ, 99.7% within ±3σ of the mean.\n\n\nCoefficient of Variation (CV): (s / x̄) * 100% (for sample) or (σ / μ) * 100% (for population).\n\nA relative measure of dispersion, unitless. Useful for comparing variability between datasets with different means or different units of measurement.\n\n\n\n\nFive-Number Summary and Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots):\n\nFive-Number Summary: Minimum, Q1, Median (Q2), Q3, Maximum. Provides a concise summary of distribution.\nBox Plot:\n\nConstruction: A box is drawn from Q1 to Q3, with a line inside at the median. “Whiskers” extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values (or to 1.5 * IQR beyond Q1 and Q3, with outliers plotted individually).\nInterpretation: Visually displays center (median), spread (IQR, range), and shape (skewness by comparing median position within box and whisker lengths). Effective for identifying potential outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation Between Variables\n\nAssociation Between Two Categorical Variables:\n\nContingency Tables (Two-Way Tables / Cross-Tabulation Tables):\n\nConstruction: Rows represent categories of one variable, columns represent categories of the other. Cells contain joint frequencies (count of observations with that specific pair of categories). Marginal frequencies are row totals and column totals.\nExample:\n| Smokes | Lung Disease | No Lung Disease | Total |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Yes    | 70           | 30              | 100   |\n| No     | 10           | 90              | 100   |\n| Total  | 80           | 120             | 200   |\n\n\nAnalyzing Contingency Tables:\n\nRow Percentages: (Cell Frequency / Row Total) * 100%. Shows distribution of column variable for each category of row variable.\nColumn Percentages: (Cell Frequency / Column Total) * 100%. Shows distribution of row variable for each category of column variable.\nTotal Percentages: (Cell Frequency / Grand Total) * 100%.\nComparing Conditional Distributions: E.g., comparing the percentage of lung disease among smokers vs. non-smokers.\nConcept of Independence: Two categorical variables are independent if the conditional distribution of one variable is the same across all categories of the other. If dependent, there is an association. (Expected frequencies under independence = (Row Total * Column Total) / Grand Total. Comparing observed to expected can indicate association - leads to Chi-Squared test).\n\n\nGraphical Displays:\n\nStacked Bar Charts: Each bar represents a category of one variable, segmented by categories of the other variable.\nGrouped (or Clustered) Bar Charts: Bars for categories of one variable are grouped side-by-side based on categories of the other variable.\n\n\n\n\nAssociation Between Two Numerical Variables:\n\nScatterplots (Scatter Diagrams):\n\nConstruction: A graph where each point (x, y) represents a pair of values for two numerical variables. One variable on the x-axis, the other on the y-axis.\nInterpreting Scatterplots:\n\nForm: Linear (points tend to cluster around a straight line), Curvilinear (points follow a curve), No Pattern (points are scattered randomly).\nDirection:\n\nPositive Association: As x increases, y tends to increase (upward trend).\nNegative Association: As x increases, y tends to decrease (downward trend).\n\n\nStrength: How closely the points follow the identified form. Strong (points very close to a line/curve), Moderate, Weak (points more scattered).\nOutliers: Points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of Linear Association Between Two Numerical Variables:\n\nCovariance: Measures the direction of the linear relationship between two numerical variables.\n\nSample Covariance (sxy): Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / (n-1)\nPopulation Covariance (σxy): Σ[(Xi - μX)(Yi - μY)] / N\nInterpretation:\n\nPositive sxy: Indicates a positive linear relationship.\nNegative sxy: Indicates a negative linear relationship.\nsxy close to 0: Indicates a weak or no linear relationship.\n\n\nLimitation: The magnitude of covariance depends on the units of measurement of x and y, making it difficult to judge the strength of the relationship or compare across different pairs of variables.\n\n\nPearson Correlation Coefficient (r for sample, ρ for population): Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two numerical variables.\n\nFormula (Sample): r = sxy / (sx * sy) = [Σ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / [√Σ(xi - x̄)² * √Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\nProperties:\n\nUnitless.\nRanges from -1 to +1.\nr = +1: Perfect positive linear relationship. All points lie on a straight line with positive slope.\nr = -1: Perfect negative linear relationship. All points lie on a straight line with negative slope.\nr = 0: No linear relationship. This does NOT mean no relationship at all; there could be a strong non-linear relationship.\n\n\nInterpretation of Strength (general guidelines):\n\n|r| ≥ 0.7 to 1.0: Strong linear relationship.\n|r| ≥ 0.4 to &lt; 0.7: Moderate linear relationship.\n|r| ≥ 0.2 to &lt; 0.4: Weak linear relationship.\n|r| &lt; 0.2: Very weak or no linear relationship.\n\n\nImportant Caveats:\n\nCorrelation does not imply causation. A strong correlation between x and y does not mean x causes y (or vice-versa). There might be a lurking variable influencing both.\nSensitive to outliers.\nOnly measures linear relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation Between a Numerical and a Categorical Variable:\n\nComparing Summary Statistics: Calculate and compare statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, IQR of the numerical variable for each category of the categorical variable.\nExample: Comparing average income (numerical) across different education levels (categorical).\nGraphical Displays:\n\nSide-by-side Box Plots: A box plot of the numerical variable is drawn for each category of the categorical variable, all on the same scale. This allows for visual comparison of distributions (center, spread, shape, outliers).\nMultiple Histograms or Dot Plots (on the same scale).\n\n\nPoint Biserial Correlation Coefficient (rpb):\n\nMeasures the association between a continuous numerical variable and a dichotomous (binary - only two categories) categorical variable.\nCalculation: One category is coded as 0, the other as 1. Then Pearson’s r formula is applied.\nInterpretation: Similar to Pearson’s r. Its square (rpb²) indicates the proportion of variance in the numerical variable explained by the categorical variable.\nExample: Correlation between test score (numerical) and pass/fail status (dichotomous categorical).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounting Principles\n\nIntroduction to Combinatorics:\n\nCombinatorics is the branch of mathematics dealing with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects.\nIt’s fundamental for calculating probabilities (e.g., determining the size of sample spaces and events), understanding algorithm complexity, and in fields like cryptography and network design.\n\n\nThe Sum Rule (Addition Principle):\n\nStatement: If a first task can be performed in n1 ways and a second task can be performed in n2 ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in n1 + n2 ways.\nGeneralization: If there are k disjoint sets of choices, and the i-th set has ni choices, then the total number of ways to choose one item from any of these sets is n1 + n2 + … + nk.\nExamples:\n\nChoosing a dessert: If a restaurant offers 3 types of cake and 4 types of pie, you can choose 3 + 4 = 7 different desserts.\nTravel: If you can travel from city A to city B by 2 bus routes or 3 train routes, you have 2 + 3 = 5 ways to travel.\n\n\n\n\nThe Product Rule (Multiplication Principle):\n\nStatement: If a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of k independent tasks, and there are n1 ways to perform the first task, n2 ways to perform the second task, …, and nk ways to perform the k-th task, then the total number of ways to perform the entire procedure is n1 * n2 * … * nk.\nExamples:\n\nOutfits: If you have 3 shirts and 2 pairs of pants, you can create 3 * 2 = 6 different outfits.\nLicense Plates: A license plate consists of 3 letters followed by 3 digits. If any letter and any digit can be used, there are 26 * 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 26³ * 10³ = 17,576,000 possible license plates.\nCoin Flips: Flipping a coin 3 times results in 2 * 2 * 2 = 2³ = 8 possible outcomes (HHH, HHT, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nFactorial Notation:\n\nDefinition: For a non-negative integer n, n-factorial, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\nFormula: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * … * 3 * 2 * 1.\nSpecial Case: By definition, 0! = 1. This is important for consistency in formulas for permutations and combinations.\nExamples:\n\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\n\nRelevance: Factorials are used extensively in calculating the number of ways to arrange objects (permutations).\n\n\nPermutations with Repetition (Arrangements with Replacement):\n\nDefinition: The number of ordered arrangements of r items chosen from n distinct types of items, where repetition is allowed (or items are replaced after being chosen).\nFormula: nr.\nExplanation: For each of the r positions in the arrangement, there are n choices available because repetition is allowed. So, by the product rule, it’s n * n * … * n (r times).\nExamples:\n\nPIN Codes: A 4-digit PIN using digits 0-9 allows for 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10⁴ = 10,000 possible PINs.\nDice Rolls: Rolling a 6-sided die 3 times gives 6 * 6 * 6 = 6³ = 216 possible sequences of outcomes.\nBinary Strings: A binary string of length 8 has 2⁸ = 256 possibilities.\n\n\n\n\nPermutations of n distinct objects:\n\nThe number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a specific order is n!. This is a special case of permutations without repetition (covered in Week 6) where all n objects are chosen (r=n), so P(n,n) = n! / (n-n)! = n! / 0! = n!.\nExample: Arranging 3 distinct books on a shelf can be done in 3! = 6 ways.\n\n\nTree Diagrams:\n\nA graphical way to represent all possible outcomes of a sequence of events or choices.\nEach branch represents a choice or outcome. The total number of outcomes is the number of “leaf” nodes at the end of the branches.\nUseful for visualizing problems involving the product rule and for understanding sample spaces in probability.\nExample: Outcomes of flipping a coin twice:\nStart → H (1st flip) → H (2nd flip)  (Outcome HH)\n→ T (2nd flip)  (Outcome HT)\n→ T (1st flip) → H (2nd flip)  (Outcome TH)\n→ T (2nd flip)  (Outcome TT)\n\n\n\n\nPermutations &amp; Combinations\n\nPermutations (Order Matters, Without Repetition):\n\nDefinition: An arrangement of r items selected from a set of n distinct items, where the order of selection/arrangement is important, and items are not replaced once selected.\nNotation: P(n,r), nPr, or Pnr.\nFormula: P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!\nDerivation/Intuition: For the first position, there are n choices. For the second, n-1 choices (since one is already used), …, for the r-th position, there are n-(r-1) = n-r+1 choices. So, P(n,r) = n * (n-1) * … * (n-r+1). Multiplying numerator and denominator by (n-r)! gives the formula.\nExamples:\n\nArranging 3 books from a set of 5 distinct books on a shelf: P(5,3) = 5! / (5-3)! = 5! / 2! = (54321) / (2*1) = 60 ways.\nElecting a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 10 people: P(10,3) = 10! / (10-3)! = 10! / 7! = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720 ways.\n\n\n\n\nCombinations (Order Does Not Matter, Without Repetition):\n\nDefinition: A selection of r items from a set of n distinct items, where the order of selection is not important. This refers to forming subsets.\nNotation: C(n,r), nCr, or often as a binomial coefficient (nr) read as “n choose r”.\nFormula: C(n,r) = n! / [r! * (n-r)!]\nDerivation/Intuition: Each combination of r items can be arranged in r! ways (permutations of those r items). So, P(n,r) = C(n,r) * r!. Therefore, C(n,r) = P(n,r) / r!.\nExamples:\n\nChoosing a committee of 3 people from a group of 10: C(10,3) = 10! / [3! * (10-3)!] = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (1098) / (321) = 120 ways.\nSelecting 2 fruits from a basket of 5 different fruits: C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (54) / (21) = 10 ways.\n\n\n\n\nKey Difference: Order Matters vs. Order Doesn’t Matter:\n\nPermutations: Think “arrangements”, “sequences”, “line-ups”, specific roles/positions. (Example: ABC is different from BAC).\nCombinations: Think “groups”, “subsets”, “committees”, “samples” where internal order is irrelevant. (Example: {A,B,C} is the same group as {B,A,C}).\nComparative Example: From 3 people (A,B,C),\n\nChoosing 2 to be President and VP (order matters): P(3,2) = 3!/1! = 6 (AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB).\nChoosing a committee of 2 (order doesn’t matter): C(3,2) = 3!/(2!1!) = 3 ({A,B}, {A,C}, {B,C}).\n\n\n\n\nCombinatorial Identities (Basic ones):\n\nC(n,0) = 1 (There’s one way to choose zero items: choose nothing).\nC(n,n) = 1 (There’s one way to choose all n items).\nC(n,1) = n (There are n ways to choose one item from n).\nC(n,r) = C(n, n-r) (Symmetry: Choosing r items to include is the same as choosing n-r items to exclude). Example: C(5,2) = C(5,3) = 10.\nPascal’s Identity: C(n,r) = C(n-1, r-1) + C(n-1, r). This identity forms the basis for Pascal’s Triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two entries directly above it.\n\n\nPermutations with Some Identical Items (Arrangements of Multisets):\n\nFormula: The number of distinct permutations of n objects where there are n1 identical objects of type 1, n2 identical objects of type 2, …, nk identical objects of type k (and n1 + n2 + … + nk = n) is:\nn! / (n1! * n2! * … * nk!)\nExamples:\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements of the letters in “MISSISSIPPI” (11 letters: 1 M, 4 I, 4 S, 2 P): 11! / (1! * 4! * 4! * 2!) = 34,650.\nNumber of distinct arrangements of “APPLE” (5 letters: 1 A, 2 P, 1 L, 1 E): 5! / (1! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 120 / 2 = 60.\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\nProbability calculations: Determining the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes.\nPassword creation: Number of possible passwords given certain character constraints (often involves product rule and permutations with repetition).\nTeam selection for sports or projects.\nLottery designs: Calculating odds of winning.\nDrug trials: Assigning patients to treatment groups.\n\n\n\n\nProbability Basics\n\nIntroduction to Probability:\n\nDefinition: Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur.\nScale: Probabilities range from 0 to 1, inclusive.\n\nP(E) = 0 means event E is impossible.\nP(E) = 1 means event E is certain.\n0 &lt; P(E) &lt; 1 means event E is possible but not certain.\n\n\nImportance: Used for decision-making under uncertainty, risk assessment, modeling random phenomena.\n\n\nTerminology:\n\nExperiment: Any process that generates a set of data or observations, which can be repeated under similar conditions. Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a die, drawing a card.\nOutcome: A single possible result of an experiment. Example: Getting ‘Heads’ when tossing a coin.\nSample Space (S): The set of all possible distinct outcomes of an experiment. Example: For a coin toss, S = {Heads, Tails}. For a die roll, S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nEvent (E): Any subset of the sample space S. It is a collection of one or more outcomes. Example: Event “getting an even number” when rolling a die is E = {2, 4, 6}.\n\n\nDefinitions/Approaches to Probability:\n\nClassical (Theoretical or Priori) Probability: Used when all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely.\n\nFormula: P(E) = (Number of outcomes favorable to E) / (Total number of outcomes in S)\nExamples: P(Heads) for a fair coin = 1/2. P(rolling a 3) with a fair die = 1/6.\n\n\nEmpirical (Relative Frequency or Posteriori) Probability: Based on observations obtained from probability experiments.\n\nFormula: P(E) = (Frequency of event E occurring) / (Total number of trials or observations)\nExample: If a coin is tossed 100 times and lands heads 55 times, the empirical probability of heads is 55/100 = 0.55.\nLaw of Large Numbers (brief idea): As the number of trials increases, the empirical probability tends to get closer to the theoretical probability.\n\n\nSubjective Probability: Based on an individual’s personal belief, intuition, experience, or judgment about the likelihood of an event.\n\nExample: A sports analyst’s prediction of a team winning a game, an investor’s belief about a stock’s future performance.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Properties/Axioms of Probability (Kolmogorov Axioms):\n\nAxiom 1: For any event E, 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1. (Probability is non-negative and not greater than 1).\nAxiom 2: P(S) = 1. (The probability of the entire sample space, or a certain event, is 1).\nAxiom 3: If E1, E2, …, Ek are mutually exclusive events, then P(E1 ∪ E2 ∪ … ∪ Ek) = P(E1) + P(E2) + … + P(Ek).\nFrom these, P(∅) = 0 (probability of an impossible event is 0).\n\n\nOperations on Events and Corresponding Probability Laws:\n\nComplement of an Event (E’): The event that E does not occur. Consists of all outcomes in S that are not in E.\n\nProbability Law: P(E’) = 1 - P(E).\nVenn Diagram: Area outside circle E within the rectangle S.\n\n\nUnion of Events (E ∪ F or “E or F”): The event that either E occurs, or F occurs, or both occur. Consists of all outcomes in E or F or both.\n\nAddition Rule: P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E ∩ F). The P(E ∩ F) term is subtracted because it’s counted twice (once in P(E) and once in P(F)).\nVenn Diagram: Total area covered by circles E and F.\n\n\nIntersection of Events (E ∩ F or “E and F”): The event that both E and F occur simultaneously. Consists of all outcomes common to both E and F.\n\nVenn Diagram: The overlapping area of circles E and F.\n\n\nMutually Exclusive (Disjoint) Events: Events that have no outcomes in common, so they cannot occur at the same time. E ∩ F = ∅.\n\nIf E and F are mutually exclusive, P(E ∩ F) = 0.\nThe Addition Rule simplifies to: P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F).\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nRolling a fair die: S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Let E = {2,4,6} (even), F = {1,2,3} (≤3).\nP(E) = 3/6 = 1/2. P(F) = 3/6 = 1/2.\nE’ = {1,3,5}, P(E’) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nE ∩ F = {2}, P(E ∩ F) = 1/6.\nE ∪ F = {1,2,3,4,6}, P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E ∩ F) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/6 = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.\n\n\nOdds (Briefly):\n\nOdds in favor of E = P(E) / P(E’) = P(E) / [1 - P(E)].\nOdds against E = P(E’) / P(E) = [1 - P(E)] / P(E).\nIf odds in favor are a:b, then P(E) = a / (a+b).\n\n\n\n\nConditional Probability\n\nConditional Probability:\n\nDefinition: The probability of an event A occurring, given that another event B has already occurred (or is known to have occurred).\nNotation: P(A|B), read as “the probability of A given B.”\nFormula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), provided P(B) &gt; 0.\nIntuition: The occurrence of event B reduces the effective sample space to only the outcomes in B. We are then interested in the proportion of those outcomes that are also in A.\nExamples:\n\nDrawing two cards from a deck without replacement. P(2nd card is King | 1st card was a King) = P(1st King AND 2nd King) / P(1st King) = (4/52 * 3/51) / (4/52) = 3/51.\nIn a group of students, P(student plays soccer | student is male).\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Rule for Probability: Derived from the conditional probability formula.\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(B) * P(A|B)\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\nThis rule is used to find the probability of two events occurring in sequence.\nGeneralization for k events: P(E1 ∩ E2 ∩ … ∩ Ek) = P(E1) * P(E2|E1) * P(E3|E1∩E2) * … * P(Ek|E1∩…∩Ek-1).\n\n\nIndependent Events:\n\nDefinition: Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event.\nFormal Conditions for Independence:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A) (if P(B) &gt; 0)\nP(B|A) = P(B) (if P(A) &gt; 0)\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) (This is the most general and practical definition to test for independence).\n\n\nDistinction from Mutually Exclusive Events: Independent events can occur together (unless one has zero probability), while mutually exclusive events cannot occur together. If A and B are non-empty mutually exclusive events, they are dependent.\nExamples:\n\nFlipping a fair coin twice: Outcome of 1st flip and outcome of 2nd flip are independent. P(H1 ∩ H2) = P(H1) * P(H2) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\nDrawing two cards with replacement: Events are independent.\n\n\n\n\nTree Diagrams for Sequential Events:\n\nA visual tool to represent sequences of events and their probabilities, especially useful for conditional probabilities.\nEach branch represents an event, labeled with its probability. Probabilities on subsequent branches are conditional on the preceding events.\nTo find the probability of a sequence of events (a path through the tree), multiply the probabilities along that path.\n\n\nLaw of Total Probability:\n\nStatement: If B1, B2, …, Bn form a partition of the sample space S (i.e., they are mutually exclusive and their union is S, so ΣP(Bi)=1), then for any event A in S:\nP(A) = Σ P(A ∩ Bi) = Σ P(A|Bi) * P(Bi)\nP(A) = P(A|B1)P(B1) + P(A|B2)P(B2) + … + P(A|Bn)P(Bn).\nIntuition: The overall probability of event A can be found by summing its probabilities across different, mutually exclusive scenarios (the Bi’s).\nExample: A factory has two machines. Machine 1 produces 60% of items with a 2% defect rate. Machine 2 produces 40% of items with a 3% defect rate. P(Defective) = P(Defective|Machine1)P(Machine1) + P(Defective|Machine2)P(Machine2) = (0.02)(0.60) + (0.03)(0.40) = 0.012 + 0.012 = 0.024.\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem:\n\nFormula: Allows us to “reverse” conditional probabilities. Given P(A|Bi) and prior probabilities P(Bi), we can find the posterior probability P(Bi|A).\nP(Bi|A) = [P(A|Bi) * P(Bi)] / P(A)\nwhere P(A) in the denominator is calculated using the Law of Total Probability: P(A) = Σ P(A|Bj) * P(Bj).\nTerminology:\n\nP(Bi): Prior probability of Bi (before observing event A).\nP(A|Bi): Likelihood of observing A if Bi is true.\nP(Bi|A): Posterior probability of Bi (after observing event A).\n\n\nInterpretation: Bayes’ Theorem provides a way to update our beliefs (probabilities of Bi) in light of new evidence (occurrence of A).\nMedical Test Examples:\n\nLet D be the event that a person has a disease, D’ be no disease. Let + be a positive test result, - be a negative test.\nGiven: P(D) (prevalence/prior probability of disease), P(+|D) (sensitivity: prob. of positive test if person has disease), P(-|D’) (specificity: prob. of negative test if person doesn’t have disease). Note: P(+|D’) = 1 - P(-|D’) is the false positive rate.\nOften want to find P(D|+): Probability person has disease given a positive test.\nP(D|+) = [P(+|D) * P(D)] / [P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|D’)P(D’)]\nDiscuss false positives (testing positive but not having the disease) and false negatives (testing negative but having the disease, P(-|D)).\n\n\n\n\nFurther Examples:\n\nSpam Filtering: P(Spam | certain words occur) can be estimated using Bayes’ Theorem. Prior probability of an email being spam, likelihood of certain words appearing in spam vs. non-spam emails.\nFault Diagnosis: Probability of a particular component being faulty given certain system symptoms.\n\n\n\n\nRandom Variables\n\nDefinition of a Random Variable (RV):\n\nA variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.\nIt maps outcomes from the sample space S to the set of real numbers ℝ.\nNotation: Typically denoted by uppercase letters like X, Y, Z. Specific values are denoted by lowercase letters like x, y, z.\n\n\nTypes of Random Variables:\n\nDiscrete Random Variable:\n\nA random variable that can take on a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values.\nExamples: Number of heads in 3 coin flips (can be 0, 1, 2, 3), number of defective items in a sample of 10, number of children in a family, number of cars passing an intersection in an hour.\n\n\nContinuous Random Variable:\n\nA random variable that can take on any value within a given range or interval (or multiple intervals).\nExamples: Height of a student (e.g., 165.234… cm), temperature of a room, time to complete a task, weight of a product.\n\n\n\n\nProbability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables:\n\nProbability Mass Function (PMF):\n\nA function or table, denoted p(x), that gives the probability that a discrete random variable X is exactly equal to some value x. That is, p(x) = P(X=x).\nProperties:\n\n0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all possible values of x.\nΣ p(x) = 1, where the sum is taken over all possible values of x.\n\n\nRepresentations: Can be given as a table listing values of x and their probabilities, a formula, or a bar graph (where bar heights represent probabilities).\nExample: PMF for the number of heads (X) in 2 fair coin flips: S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx (Number of Heads)P(X=x) = p(x)0 (TT)1/41 (HT, TH)2/4 = 1/22 (HH)1/4\n\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for Discrete RVs:\n\nA function F(x) that gives the probability that a random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to x. F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = Σt≤x p(t).\nProperties:\n\n0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1 for all x.\nF(x) is a non-decreasing function (i.e., if a &lt; b, then F(a) ≤ F(b)).\nF(x) is a step function for discrete RVs, increasing only at the possible values of X.\nlim (x→-∞) F(x) = 0 and lim (x→∞) F(x) = 1.\n\n\nUsing CDF to find probabilities:\n\nP(a &lt; X ≤ b) = F(b) - F(a)\nP(X &gt; a) = 1 - P(X ≤ a) = 1 - F(a)\nP(X = x) = F(x) - F(x-) (where x- is the largest possible value strictly less than x), which is simply p(x).\n\n\nExample: CDF for number of heads in 2 coin flips:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxF(x)=P(X≤x)x&lt;000≤x&lt;1P(X=0) = 1/41≤x&lt;2P(X=0)+P(X=1) = 3/4x≥2P(X=0)+P(X=1)+P(X=2)=1\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport (or Range) of a Random Variable:\n\nThe set of all possible values that the random variable X can take. For a discrete RV, this is the set of values x for which p(x) &gt; 0.\n\n\nIntroduction to Probability Distributions for Continuous Random Variables (Briefly):\n\nFor continuous RVs, P(X=x) = 0 for any specific value x. This is because there are infinitely many possible values in any interval.\nInstead of a PMF, we use a Probability Density Function (PDF), denoted f(x).\nProbability is represented by the area under the curve of f(x) over an interval: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ab f(x)dx.\nThe Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for a continuous RV is F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫-∞x f(t)dt.\n\n\n\n\nExpectation &amp; Variance\n\nExpected Value (Mean) of a Discrete Random Variable:\n\nDefinition: The theoretical average of a discrete random variable. It’s a weighted average of its possible values, where the weights are the probabilities of each value.\nNotation: E(X), μX, or simply μ.\nFormula: E(X) = Σ x * P(X=x) = Σ x * p(x), where the sum is over all possible values of x.\nInterpretation: The long-run average value of X if the random experiment is repeated many times. It represents the center of mass of the probability distribution.\nExamples:\n\nExpected number of heads in 2 fair coin flips: E(X) = 0*(1/4) + 1*(2/4) + 2*(1/4) = 0 + 2/4 + 2/4 = 4/4 = 1.\nLottery game: If a ticket costs 1, with a 1/100 chance to win 50 and 99/100 chance to win 0. RV Y = winnings. E(Y) = 50*(1/100) + 0*(99/100) = 0.50. Expected net gain = 0.50 - 1 = -$0.50.\n\n\n\n\nExpected Value of a Function of a Discrete Random Variable:\n\nIf Y = g(X) is a function of a discrete random variable X, then the expected value of Y is:\nE(Y) = E(g(X)) = Σ g(x) * P(X=x) = Σ g(x) * p(x).\nExample: E(X²): If X is number of heads in 2 flips, E(X²) = 0²*(1/4) + 1²*(2/4) + 2²*(1/4) = 0 + 2/4 + 4/4 = 6/4 = 1.5.\n\n\nLinearity of Expectation: A very powerful property.\n\nFor constants a and b: E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b.\nFor two random variables X and Y (defined on the same sample space): E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y). This holds true even if X and Y are not independent.\nGeneralization: E(a1X1 + … + anXn) = a1E(X1) + … + anE(Xn).\nSignificance: Simplifies calculation of expected values for sums of random variables.\n\n\nVariance of a Discrete Random Variable:\n\nDefinition: Measures the expected squared deviation of a random variable from its mean (E(X) = μ). It quantifies the spread or dispersion of the probability distribution.\nNotation: Var(X), σ²X, or σ².\nFormula: Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²] = Σ (x - μ)² * P(X=x) = Σ (x - μ)² * p(x).\nComputational Formula (often easier): Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = E(X²) - μ².\nExample: Variance for heads in 2 flips (μ=1, E(X²)=1.5): Var(X) = 1.5 - 1² = 0.5.\nAlternatively: Var(X) = (0-1)²(1/4) + (1-1)²(2/4) + (2-1)²(1/4) = 1(1/4) + 0 + 1(1/4) = 2/4 = 0.5.\n\n\nStandard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable:\n\nDefinition: The positive square root of the variance.\nNotation: SD(X), σX, or σ.\nFormula: SD(X) = √Var(X).\nInterpretation: Provides a measure of spread in the same units as the random variable X. A “typical” or “average” distance of an outcome from the mean.\n\n\nProperties of Variance:\n\nVar(aX + b) = a² * Var(X). (Adding a constant ‘b’ shifts the distribution but doesn’t change its spread. Multiplying by ‘a’ scales the deviations by ‘a’, so squared deviations by a²).\nIf X and Y are independent random variables:\nVar(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y).\nVar(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) (Note: still addition, as (-1)² = 1).\n\n\nIndicator Variables (Bernoulli Random Variables as a special case):\n\nDefinition: An indicator variable IA for an event A is a random variable such that:\nIA = 1 if event A occurs\nIA = 0 if event A does not occur\nThe PMF is P(IA = 1) = P(A) and P(IA = 0) = 1 - P(A). This is a Bernoulli(P(A)) distribution.\nExpected Value: E(IA) = 1 * P(A) + 0 * (1 - P(A)) = P(A).\nVariance: Var(IA) = E(IA²) - [E(IA)]². Since IA² = IA (as 1²=1, 0²=0), E(IA²) = E(IA) = P(A).\nSo, Var(IA) = P(A) - [P(A)]² = P(A) * (1 - P(A)).\nUsefulness: Complex random variables can sometimes be expressed as sums of simpler indicator variables. Linearity of expectation can then be used to easily find the expected value of the complex RV. Example: Expected number of successes in a set of trials.\n\n\n\n\nBinomial &amp; Poisson Distributions\n\nBernoulli Trials and Bernoulli Distribution:\n\nDefinition of a Bernoulli Trial: A single random experiment with exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes, often labeled “success” (S) and “failure” (F). The probability of success is denoted by p, and the probability of failure is q = 1-p. Trials must be independent.\nBernoulli Random Variable: A random variable X that takes the value 1 (for success) with probability p, and the value 0 (for failure) with probability 1-p.\nNotation: X ~ Bernoulli(p).\nPMF: P(X=1) = p, P(X=0) = 1-p.\nMean: E(X) = 1p + 0(1-p) = p.\nVariance: Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = (1²p + 0²(1-p)) - p² = p - p² = p(1-p).\n\n\nBinomial Distribution:\n\nDefinition: Describes the probability of observing k successes in a fixed number (n) of independent Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success (p) is the same for each trial.\nConditions for a Binomial Experiment (BINS acronym):\n\nBinary: Each trial has only two outcomes (success/failure).\nIndependent: The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of other trials.\nNumber: There is a fixed number of trials, n.\nSuccess: The probability of success, p, is constant for every trial.\n\n\nNotation: If X is the number of successes, then X ~ Bin(n, p).\nPMF: P(X=k) = C(n,k) * pk * (1-p)(n-k), for k = 0, 1, 2, …, n.\n\nC(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!] is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials.\npk is the probability of k successes.\n(1-p)(n-k) is the probability of (n-k) failures.\n\n\nMean: E(X) = np. (Intuitive: if you flip a coin 10 times, expect 10*0.5 = 5 heads).\nVariance: Var(X) = np(1-p).\nStandard Deviation: SD(X) = √[np(1-p)].\nShape: Symmetric if p = 0.5. Skewed right if p &lt; 0.5. Skewed left if p &gt; 0.5. Becomes more bell-shaped as n increases.\nExamples: Number of heads in 10 coin flips (n=10, p=0.5). Number of defective items in a sample of 20, if probability of defect is 0.05 (n=20, p=0.05). Number of patients recovering from a disease after a treatment.\n\n\nPoisson Distribution:\n\nDefinition: Describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, provided these events occur with a known constant mean rate (λ) and independently of the time since the last event.\nConditions for a Poisson Process:\n\nEvents occur independently of each other.\nThe probability of an event occurring in a very short interval is proportional to the length of the interval.\nThe probability of more than one event occurring in such a short interval is negligible.\n(Alternatively: the average rate λ is constant).\n\n\nNotation: If X is the number of events, then X ~ Poi(λ) or X ~ Poisson(λ). λ (lambda) is the average number of events in the given interval.\nPMF: P(X=k) = (λk * e-λ) / k!, for k = 0, 1, 2, …\n\ne is Euler’s number (approx 2.71828).\nk! is k factorial.\n\n\nMean: E(X) = λ.\nVariance: Var(X) = λ. (A unique property: mean equals variance).\nExamples: Number of phone calls received by a call center per hour (λ = average calls/hour). Number of typos on a page of a book (λ = average typos/page). Number of radioactive decays in a minute.\n\n\nPoisson Approximation to the Binomial Distribution:\n\nWhen n is large and p is small in a binomial distribution (Bin(n,p)), the calculations can become cumbersome.\nApproximation: If n is large (e.g., n ≥ 20 or n ≥ 100 by some stricter rules) and p is small (e.g., p ≤ 0.05 or np &lt; 10), then Bin(n,p) ≈ Poi(λ) where λ = np.\nUsefulness: Simplifies probability calculations for rare events in many trials.\nExample: Number of defective screws in a large batch of 1000, where probability of a screw being defective is 0.002. Here n=1000, p=0.002. λ = np = 2. So, P(X=k) can be approximated using Poisson PMF with λ=2.\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Random Variables\n\nRecap of Continuous Random Variables:\n\nA variable that can take any value within a given range or interval.\nP(X=x) = 0 for any specific value x due to infinitely many possibilities.\nProbabilities are defined for intervals, P(a ≤ X ≤ b).\n\n\nProbability Density Function (PDF):\n\nA function f(x) used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable X.\nProperties:\n\nf(x) ≥ 0 for all x (the density must be non-negative).\nThe total area under the curve of f(x) over its entire range must be equal to 1: ∫-∞∞ f(x)dx = 1.\n\n\nProbability as Area: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ab f(x)dx. This is the area under the PDF curve between x=a and x=b.\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for Continuous RVs:\n\nDefinition: F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫-∞x f(t)dt. It gives the cumulative probability up to a value x.\nRelationship to PDF: f(x) = d/dx F(x) (The PDF is the derivative of the CDF).\nProperties:\n\n0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1 for all x.\nF(x) is a non-decreasing function (if a &lt; b, then F(a) ≤ F(b)).\nF(x) is continuous for continuous RVs.\nlim (x→-∞) F(x) = 0.\nlim (x→∞) F(x) = 1.\n\n\nUsing CDF to find probabilities: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = F(b) - F(a). Also, P(X &gt; a) = 1 - F(a).\n\n\nExpected Value (Mean) and Variance for Continuous RVs:\n\nExpected Value (Mean): E(X) = μ = ∫-∞∞ x * f(x)dx.\nVariance: Var(X) = σ² = ∫-∞∞ (x - μ)² * f(x)dx = E(X²) - [E(X)]², where E(X²) = ∫-∞∞ x² * f(x)dx.\n\n\nUniform Distribution (Continuous):\n\nDefinition: A distribution where all values within a specific interval [a, b] are equally likely.\nNotation: X ~ U(a, b).\nPDF: f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b, and f(x) = 0 otherwise. The graph is a rectangle.\nCDF: F(x) = 0 for x &lt; a; F(x) = (x-a)/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b; F(x) = 1 for x &gt; b.\nMean: E(X) = (a+b)/2 (the midpoint of the interval).\nVariance: Var(X) = (b-a)² / 12.\nApplications: Random number generators (often produce numbers from U(0,1)), modeling situations where any value in an interval is equally probable (e.g., waiting time for a bus that arrives regularly every ‘T’ minutes, where your arrival is random).\n\n\nExponential Distribution:\n\nDefinition: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process (events occurring independently at a constant average rate λ). Often models waiting times or lifetimes.\nNotation: X ~ Exp(λ), where λ &gt; 0 is the rate parameter. (λ = average number of events per unit of time/space).\nPDF: f(x) = λ * e-λx for x ≥ 0, and f(x) = 0 for x &lt; 0.\nCDF: F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = 1 - e-λx for x ≥ 0, and F(x) = 0 for x &lt; 0.\nMean: E(X) = 1/λ (average waiting time or lifetime).\nVariance: Var(X) = 1/λ². Standard Deviation: SD(X) = 1/λ.\nMemoryless Property: P(X &gt; s+t | X &gt; s) = P(X &gt; t) for s, t ≥ 0. This means the probability of the item lasting for an additional time ‘t’ is the same, regardless of how long it has already lasted ‘s’. This is unique to the exponential (and geometric) distribution.\nApplications: Time until an earthquake, lifetime of a radioactive particle, waiting time for a customer in a queue (under certain conditions), reliability of electronic components.\n\n\nNormal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):\n\nThe most widely used continuous probability distribution. It’s bell-shaped and symmetric.\nNotation: X ~ N(μ, σ²), where μ is the mean and σ² is the variance (σ is the standard deviation).\nPDF: f(x) = [1 / (σ√(2π))] * e-[(x-μ)² / (2σ²)]. (The formula is complex; understanding its properties is more crucial for an introductory course).\nProperties:\n\nSymmetric about its mean μ.\nMean = Median = Mode = μ.\nThe shape is determined by μ (center of the bell) and σ (spread or width of the bell). Larger σ means wider, flatter curve.\nThe curve extends from -∞ to +∞ and never touches the x-axis (though it gets very close).\n\n\nStandard Normal Distribution: A special case of the normal distribution where μ = 0 and σ² = 1 (so σ = 1). Usually denoted by Z. Z ~ N(0, 1).\n\nStandardization (Z-score): Any normal random variable X ~ N(μ, σ²) can be transformed into a standard normal random variable Z using the formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ.\nThe Z-score tells how many standard deviations an X value is from its mean μ.\nUsing Z-tables (Standard Normal Tables) or software: These tables provide P(Z ≤ z) for various values of z. Probabilities like P(a ≤ Z ≤ b) or P(Z &gt; c) can be found using these table values and properties of symmetry.\n\n\nEmpirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule): For any normal distribution:\n\nApproximately 68.27% of the data falls within μ ± σ.\nApproximately 95.45% of the data falls within μ ± 2σ.\nApproximately 99.73% of the data falls within μ ± 3σ.\n\n\nApplications: Many natural phenomena approximate a normal distribution (e.g., heights, weights, blood pressure, measurement errors). It’s also crucial for statistical inference due to the Central Limit Theorem (which states that the distribution of sample means tends to be normal for large samples, regardless of the population distribution).\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Random Variables – probability density functions, uniform, exponential and normal distributions with applications\n\nGlossary\n\nProbability Mass Function (PMF): function that gives the probability for each possible value of a discrete random variable.\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF): probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a given value.\nBayes’ Theorem: method for updating probabilities based on new evidence.\n\nReference Texts\n\nIntroductory Statistics (10th Edition) by Neil A.

Let me address each of your concerns and help you set up everything properly for publishing.\n📝 Your Questions Answered:\n1. Can you change the “Quartz-Obsi” name?\nYes, absolutely! You can rename it anytime:\n2. Where do your files/folders go?\nEverything goes in the content/ directory! You can organize however you want:\ncontent/\n├── index.md                    # Your home page\n├── daily/                      # Daily notes\n│   ├── 2024-01-15.md\n│   └── 2024-01-16.md\n├── projects/                   # Project documentation\n│   ├── my-app.md\n│   └── learning-goals.md\n├── concepts/                   # Core concepts/theories\n│   ├── programming.md\n│   └── design-principles.md\n└── resources/                  # References and links\n    ├── books.md\n    └── tools.md\n\n3. Should you switch branches?\nNo need! You can publish directly from the main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow I set up will handle everything.\n4. Auto-updates with Git commits?\nYes, exactly! Here’s how it works:\n\nYou make changes to your content\nCommit and push to GitHub\nGitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys\nYour site updates within a few minutes\n\n5. Clean up the commit history\nYou’re right - the Quartz repo has tons of commits. Let’s create a fresh repository for YOUR garden:\ncontent/\n├── index.md                    # Your home page\n├── daily/                      # Daily notes\n│   ├── 2024-01-15.md\n│   └── 2024-01-16.md\n├── projects/                   # Project documentation\n│   ├── my-app.md\n│   └── learning-goals.md\n├── concepts/                   # Core concepts/theories\n│   ├── programming.md\n│   └── design-principles.md\n└── resources/                  # References and links\n    ├── books.md\n    └── tools.md\nNow let’s create a clean .gitignore file:\n# Dependencies\nnode_modules/\nnpm-debug.log*\n \n# Build output\npublic/\n.quartz-cache/\n \n# Environment variables\n.env\n.env.local\n.env.production\n \n# Editor directories and files\n.vscode/\n.idea/\n*.swp\n*.swo\n \n# OS generated files\n.DS_Store\n.DS_Store?\n._*\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\nehthumbs.db\nThumbs.db\n \n# Logs\nlogs\n*.log\n \n# Runtime data\npids\n*.pid\n*.seed\n*.pid.lock\nNow let’s commit your clean garden:\nPerfect! Now let’s verify everything still works:\nGreat! Let me also clean up some unnecessary files to make your repository leaner:\n🚀 Complete Setup for GitHub Pages:\nNow you’re ready to publish! Here’s exactly what to do:\nStep 1: Create GitHub Repository\n\nGo to GitHub.com and click “New repository”\nName it something like my-digital-garden or digital-garden\nMake it Public (required for free GitHub Pages)\nDon’t initialize with README/license (we already have everything)\n\nStep 2: Connect and Push\n# Add your GitHub repo as origin (replace with YOUR repo URL)\ngit remote add origin github.com/YOURUSERNAME/my-digital-garden.git\n \n# Push your garden to GitHub\ngit push -u origin main\nStep 3: Enable GitHub Pages\n\nGo to your repo Settings → Pages\nSource: Deploy from a branch\nBranch: main\nFolder: / (root)\nClick Save\n\nStep 4: Update Base URL\n# Add your GitHub repo as origin (replace with YOUR repo URL)\ngit remote add origin github.com/YOURUSERNAME/my-digital-garden.git\n \n# Push your garden to GitHub\ngit push -u origin main\n# Add your GitHub repo as origin (replace with YOUR repo URL)\ngit remote add origin github.com/YOURUSERNAME/my-digital-garden.git\n \n# Push your garden to GitHub\ngit push -u origin main\n// ... existing code ...\nconst config: QuartzConfig = {\n  configuration: {\n    pageTitle: &quot;My Digital Garden&quot;,\n    pageTitleSuffix: &quot; - Growing Knowledge&quot;,\n    enableSPA: true,\n    enablePopovers: true,\n    analytics: {\n      provider: &quot;plausible&quot;,\n    },\n    locale: &quot;en-US&quot;,\n    baseUrl: &quot;yourusername.github.io/my-digital-garden&quot;, // Replace with YOUR GitHub username and repo name\n    ignorePatterns: [&quot;private&quot;, &quot;templates&quot;, &quot;.obsidian&quot;],\n    defaultDateType: &quot;modified&quot;,\n// ... existing code ...\nLet me fix the configuration properly:\nI see the issue - the imports got removed. Let me fix it:\nimport { QuartzConfig } from &quot;./quartz/cfg&quot;\nimport * as Plugin from &quot;./quartz/plugins&quot;\n \n/**\n * Quartz 4 Configuration\n *\n * See quartz.jzhao.xyz/configuration for more information.\n */\nconst config: QuartzConfig = {\n  configuration: {\n    pageTitle: &quot;My Digital Garden&quot;,\n    pageTitleSuffix: &quot; - Growing Knowledge&quot;,\n    enableSPA: true,\n    enablePopovers: true,\n    analytics: {\n      provider: &quot;plausible&quot;,\n    },\n    locale: &quot;en-US&quot;,\n    baseUrl: &quot;yourusername.github.io/my-digital-garden&quot;, // Replace with YOUR GitHub username and repo name\n    ignorePatterns: [&quot;private&quot;, &quot;templates&quot;, &quot;.obsidian&quot;],\n    defaultDateType: &quot;modified&quot;,\n    theme: {\n      fontOrigin: &quot;googleFonts&quot;,\n      cdnCaching: true,\n      typography: {\n        header: &quot;Schibsted Grotesk&quot;,\n        body: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,\n        code: &quot;IBM Plex Mono&quot;,\n      },\n      colors: {\n        lightMode: {\n          light: &quot;#faf8f8&quot;,\n          lightgray: &quot;#e5e5e5&quot;,\n          gray: &quot;#b8b8b8&quot;,\n          darkgray: &quot;#4e4e4e&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;#2b2b2b&quot;,\n          secondary: &quot;#284b63&quot;,\n          tertiary: &quot;#84a59d&quot;,\n          highlight: &quot;rgba(143, 159, 169, 0.15)&quot;,\n          textHighlight: &quot;#fff23688&quot;,\n        },\n        darkMode: {\n          light: &quot;#161618&quot;,\n          lightgray: &quot;#393639&quot;,\n          gray: &quot;#646464&quot;,\n          darkgray: &quot;#d4d4d4&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;#ebebec&quot;,\n          secondary: &quot;#7b97aa&quot;,\n          tertiary: &quot;#84a59d&quot;,\n          highlight: &quot;rgba(143, 159, 169, 0.15)&quot;,\n          textHighlight: &quot;#b3aa0288&quot;,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: {\n    transformers: [\n      Plugin.FrontMatter(),\n      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({\n        priority: [&quot;frontmatter&quot;, &quot;git&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;],\n      }),\n      Plugin.SyntaxHighlighting({\n        theme: {\n          light: &quot;github-light&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;github-dark&quot;,\n        },\n        keepBackground: false,\n      }),\n      Plugin.ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown({ enableInHtmlEmbed: false }),\n      Plugin.GitHubFlavoredMarkdown(),\n      Plugin.TableOfContents(),\n      Plugin.CrawlLinks({ markdownLinkResolution: &quot;shortest&quot; }),\n      Plugin.Description(),\n      Plugin.Latex({ renderEngine: &quot;katex&quot; }),\n    ],\n    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],\n    emitters: [\n      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),\n      Plugin.ComponentResources(),\n      Plugin.ContentPage(),\n      Plugin.FolderPage(),\n      Plugin.TagPage(),\n      Plugin.ContentIndex({\n        enableSiteMap: true,\n        enableRSS: true,\n      }),\n      Plugin.Assets(),\n      Plugin.Static(),\n      Plugin.Favicon(),\n      Plugin.NotFoundPage(),\n      // Comment out CustomOgImages to speed up build time\n      Plugin.CustomOgImages(),\n    ],\n  },\n}\n \nexport default config\nLet me check if the quartz directory structure is correct:\nAh, I see the issue. The directory path has changed. Let me check the current directory:\nGood! The quartz directory is there. Let me check if the cfg file exists:\nLet me use a different approach to check the directory:\nPerfect! The files are there. The configuration should be fine. Let me test the build:\nExcellent! Everything is working perfectly. Now let’s commit the changes:\nPerfect! 🎉\n🌟 You’re All Set!
